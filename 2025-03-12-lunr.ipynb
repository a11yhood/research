One particular teacher had this idea:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My idea would help with the organization and storage of equipment that is used by students with hearing loss. We provide FM equipment to approximately 200 students in 13 districts, so we have a large inventory of equipment to organize.

Many of the pieces of equipment are small enough to be organized within plastic craft organizers, but we would like to improve our storage of the FM microphones\\/transmitters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically, it's a drawer divider that would be a custom size to hold the transmitter units. We currently use very old foam that was used for shipping some equipment that we no longer use, but it has helped us store the pieces more securely than just having to put them all together in one drawer.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI designed these 3-D printable boxes as a solution to this problem.

After a discussion on a facebook group, in which a member shared their work to help a good friend in a difficult situation, my good friend Janet and I started talking.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI came out in 2015,  and have been excited to share my discoveries and understandings of my gender as I've grown, and I've been very lucky to have friends who are not only keen to understand, but are happy to help the community whenever possible. The facebook post prompted a discussion about what packers are and how they help the trans community. Through this we discovered a need within the trans community, a need that knitting and crochet could alleviate. \\r\\nNow, several of us are working to get 65 packers and 20 pairs of breast forms in time for this holiday season. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow you're probably wondering what this pattern is. \\r\\n\\r\\nA Knit Packer is a gender affirming item that is worn to create the silhouette in your jeans. Typically these can be worn by trans and non-binary folks for a variety of reasons, one of which is to mitigate gender dysphoria. \\r\\n\\r\\nElastomer or silicone packers are expensive, difficult to source, and behind barriers such as only available online. While yes this item appears to be rather mature, the product itself is not. It's designed with the idea in mind that someone out there could use a packer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey take very little time to knit up, are versatile  in size and stuffyness depending on your choice as you knit them. Be aware that should you decide to create something bigger, the fabric of the knit piece should remain tight to prevent stuffing from pushing out through the stitches. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso this packer lets you decide if that's something you're comfortable with wearing.

The term was coined by Christine Miserandino when she used spoons to explain the fatigue her lupus caused. A spoonie only gets a limited number of spoons (energy) each day and each day is different. If you start out your day with only 8 or 9 spoons and it takes a spoon to shower, another to get dressed, another for breakfast, and another to drive to work or the grocery store or take the kids to school, it is difficult to get through the day. It becomes necessary to weigh each decision\\u2014\\u201cIf I get a shower, will I still have enough energy to wash a load of clothes so we have clothes for tomorrow?\\u201d Or\\u2014\\u201cIf I go grocery shopping today, we are going to have to get takeout tonight because I won\\u2019t have enough spoons left to cook let alone clean the kitchen afterward.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFibromyalgia introduced me to the spoonie world. Summer air conditioning and fans are painful for me when the air hits my hands. I needed something I could carry with me and use just on my wrists and top of my hands where cold air causes pain. These are perfect for adding protection right where I need it without causing more pain. I hope you also find them useful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Notes on Fit:**\\r\\nMy hands are often swollen and my skin signals pain at the slightest touch, so the loose cozies are made to fit quite loosely. The loose cozies on size 7 needles have about an inch of ease for my comfort level. (30stitches on size 7 needles.)  \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, these were big on several of my testers. The close fit  feels okay on me, but not when my allodynia is active. For those with even smaller wrists or who want an even closer fit, I would suggest using size 6 needles instead. The great thing is that these are a quick knit so knitting multiple sizes is easy. \\r\\n\\r\\nA swatch is not recommended because one of these actually has fewer stitches than a swatch would. Knit one and try it on to see before you cut your yarn to find the best size.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also 2 optional rows which you can add as many times as you like to make your cozies longer.\\r\\n\",\"service\":\"ravelry\",\"name\":\"Spoonie Wrist Cozies\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thingiverse.com\\/thing:683496\",\"description\":\"These files are parts that I modified for use in making the E-nable RIT 3D printed prosthetic arm.

Includes 4 sizes: Adult S, L and XL, and the Bitty Bug for youths.\\r\\n\\r\\n* 4 Sizes\\r\\n* Full photo tutorial\\r\\n* Sized, shaped and stuffed to be anatomically proximal\\r\\n* Designed by a member of the trans community\\r\\n* Tested by the trans and non-binary community\\r\\n\\r\\n**The Lil' Bug story:**\\r\\nIn October 2019 I was looking for a pattern to make a soft packer for myself, after being frustrated by the cost and discomfort of silicone options. \\r\\n\\r\\nSilicone packers are expensive, heavy, and can get hot, sticky and uncomfortable. They come in limited sizes and colors, and unless worn with a strap, they weigh down clothing and don't stay put. They have to be powdered and cared for carefully, and even then only last about 6 months with daily wear. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe crochet options I found were oversized and comical, not designed to look good or be comfortable under clothing. I started to think making my own pattern might be necessary. I tried the free patterns I could find, and posted some photos in a large LGBTQ+ sewing group. Immediately I had 2 parents ask me if I could please make something like this for their young trans sons. After hearing from a mother who didn't know what else to do than just cry with her son, unsure how to ease his dysphoria with no options available for children, I decided to add the youth size to my pattern. The very first Bitty Bug packers I made were for 10 and 6 year old boys. I'm honored to have been a small part of their gender journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on a mission to make a quality, comfortable packer that could be available to anyone in any shape, color, or size, and that they could make themselves. I designed, tested and refined the Lil' Bug with a group of friends and wonderful, experienced crochet testers. I sent them out to trans people to road test, and wore them myself. The resulting design is functional, comfortable, visually appropriate, and most importantly, feels good to wear. The presence that a packer has when worn is the most important part for most folks of addressing dysphoria.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why isn't this pattern free?**\\r\\nIt is important to pay marginalized people for their creative work, and these small sales help support my queer family by covering a small part of the cost of providing packers for free. Accessibility is important to me, and if anyone needs it for free, please contact me.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Ways to Participate**\\r\\nI am committed to helping my community have access to the things we want and need.

It\\u2018s in this context that sensory materials take shape, they aren\\u2019t just games but tools to help the child in the initial period of his life in which he has a particular need to perform sensory activities. \\r\\nWith Montessori materials children develop their cognitive powers through direct experience:\\u00a0seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, and movement. I designed this cube so that it could reflect the characteristics of Montessori materials: natural and quality materials,  simple and realistic shapes, each cube face dedicated to a single activity linked to  a precise sensation to give to the child. A simple and safe toy with which the child can interact freely and that will grow with him. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cube consists of 6 faces crocheted separately and then joined wit a round of simple crochet stitches.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI made this cube for my 8 month old niece, since she is attracted by any sounds and she likes rattles then I inserted a rattle box inside the  sun and the cloud but you can quietly not put them, it\\u2019s your free choice\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cube is of 12 cm\\/ 5\\u201d in side and 24 cm\\/10 \\u201c in height.

Knitters, crocheters, and seamstresses have been working tirelessly to produce these. People are 3d printing them, too. I\\u2019ve been making lots of them, and I ordered some buttons, but they won\\u2019t get here for another couple weeks (for obvious shipping delay reasons because, you know, pandemic). I didn\\u2019t want to wait that long to start donating them, though. So I started searching for alternatives to buttons and this is what I came up with.

Even so, I wouldn't go more than an amp or two since 1\\/8\\\" (3.5mm) audio phone connectors are not designed to handle power. The physical size of this switch necessitates a  larger enclosure but is well suited to higher current applications such as motorized toys that have been switch adapted. As always, be aware of the load current of your application and make sure it does not exceed the rating of your AT switch. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis three part enclosure (no screws) makes the momentary microswitch more durable and accessible by providing protection and a larger activation surface. Designed with **OpenSCAD**, this parametric design allows selecting the build diameter, base style (plain or strap mounting) and button style (recessed or protruding) using **Customizer**. Make sure the custom diameter setting matches each of the three parts saved to insure they fit together. This version features a threaded latch and uses **radial flexures** for frictionless activation. Although it is frictionless, there is resistance from the flexures which increases the activation force slightly.

Traditional breast prostheses are usually expensive, heavy, sweaty, and uncomfortable. They typically require special bras or camisoles with pockets, and they can\\u2019t be worn for many weeks after surgery. Knitted Knockers, however, are soft, comfortable, beautiful, and when placed in a regular bra - they take the shape and feel of a real breast. Knitted Knockers can be adjusted to fill a gap for uneven breasts, and they are easily adapted for those going through reconstruction by simply removing some of the stuffing.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Materials**\\r\\n1 set 6\\u201d double point needles, size US 5 or 6.

I've made an object, to help me improve my skills, and to help other people with every day problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroducing the EasyFork. The EasyFork, is exactly what it sounds like. It's a fork, made for use by people who have trouble gripping onto things, weather heavily disabled, or just mild arthritis, the EasyFork is good for most everything. My inspiration for this was the fact that my grandfather had Parkinson's, and couldn't hold onto his own fork or spoon. With simple full hand grips, it makes it easy to start using the EasyFork, and easy to hold onto it.

Although it has the same parts as the cochlear implant, it is much smaller yet works better than the implant. The transmitter and receiver\\/stimulator gets attached to the back of the ear, on the earpiece, and the microphone and speech processor are on the part of the piece that comes around the pinna, or the top of the ear. This is continued down to the middle and inside of the ear and extends just about to the ear drum, where it sends information signals that bounce off the ear drum to the cochlea. (Even if the ear drum has a hole in it that prevents regular sound to bounce off of it, the non-surgical cochlear implant can still send information through to the cochlea properly). From here, the signal enters the hearing nerve so it can be received by the brain.   \\nThis is a prototype but the actual piece that would be made would have to be inserted into the ear my a professional doctor. The wire that goes around the top of the ear and attaches to the microphone and speech processor, is flexible so it can adjust to anyone's ear. Also this wire can be printed using a flexible materials rather than plastic, some parts cannot be printed.   \\nThese parts include an arduino chip programmed specifically to ensure the smooth operation of this device. The arduino chip would recieve, transmit and stimulate the sounds coming in through the microphone (wires connecting the arduino and microphone will also be required if everything is bought seperately). The microphone is also another piece that will not be printed, however all of these non-printed parts will fit perfectly into the 3D printed design. In total, the arduino chip and microphone would cost about $100-$150 depending on where you are purchasing it from. \",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Non-Surgical Cochlear Implant\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/comfort-rice-bag\",\"description\":\"I designed this simple crochet comfort rice bag out of personal necessity for myself.

His friend and ally had posted pictures of the crocheted packer she'd made him as a replacement.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I had to figure out what a packer was (which didn't take long - there were pictures). Then I had to ask a friend who is an LPN in inpatient mental health why packers might be taken away. This led to a long and winding conversation with him, contacts in the trans community, and several others, which in turn led to the organization of [Dongalong 2019][1]: a month long knitalong\\/crochetalong campaign to design, produce, and distribute five dozen packers and two dozen pairs of knockers (breast forms) to trans and non-binary youth and adults in our area for the holidays.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dongalong story was [picked up by the local newspaper][2] and CBC radio and from there spread to other parts of Nova Scotia and other provinces entirely.

The **default is Thin** (.8mm) as supplied by **SparkFun Electronics**. However the **Thick** setting will change the base part standoff height to accommodate a 1.6mm PCB thickness (as found on Amazon and elsewhere in the internet). \\r\\n* Since **Thingiverse Customizer** is still unreliable, I have posted **more STL file options** to make it easier to download the  size and button style you prefer.

This version uses a very small **\\\"Lilypad Button Board\\\"** with low activation force and capable of signal level switching, \\r\\n\\r\\nThis three part enclosure (no screws) makes a small momentary tactile button switch more durable and accessible by providing protection and a larger activation surface. Designed with **OpenSCAD**, this parametric design allows selecting the build diameter, base style (plain or strap mounting) and button style (recessed or protruding). STL files for the small, medium and large sizes are provided for convenience. For other options use the **Customizer**. Make sure the custom diameter setting matches each of the three parts saved to insure they fit together. This version features a threaded latch and uses **radial flexures** for frictionless activation.

It conveys point-distance information and could be used as a part of an assembly of assistive devices or as an augmentation to a regular white cane.

It will also probably extend the life of the part because there is much less TPU being moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nI created this design because I was curious about the potential for combining flexible filament with stiff PLA. Thermoplastic polyurethane or TPU comes out of the extruder slightly tacky. Once cooled it doesn't stretch, but will flex and bend when force is applied returning to its original position afterwards. My idea was to incorporate a flexible joint with stiff structure to make it bend in predictable ways.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThis my first design using TPU, so I decided to make something that I could test simply.

A 10 mm ring will come closer to matching the device that you'll end up putting on your fingers and will better represent the stability that a thicker ring will provide and the amount of friction that the additional surface area will impose as you try to slip it on and off your finger.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can learn more about these measuring rings - by going here: https:\\/\\/wp.me\\/P9evBA-hR\\r\\n\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Measuring Stars\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/VGamezz19\\/GefCore\",\"description\":\"\\ud83d\\uded1 MEAN \\ud83d\\udd30 In collaboration for La Once.

October is also the month of my grandmothers birthday and about 10 years ago she was diagnosed with Alzheimer.  A debilitating disease that would eventually lead too her death.  In the approximate 8 years she lived prior to her death she slowly withered away.  It is my experiences in the nursing homes and hospitals where I would spend most of my time watching family caring for my grandmother that I began imagining ideas to help her.  When looking back at those experiences I found inspiration to create Grip_Zz.  I designed this based on a motorcycle grip combined with integrated pressure plates to contain objects. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Objective of Grip_Zz is to integrate the ability to comfortably hold a toothbrush, spoon, or fork without slippage.  The grip_Zz extends the average handle of the object placed in the receptacle allowing for easier handling.  This means that patients who have difficult times brushing their teeth due to most debilitating diseases can now hold a toothbrush or other utensils with much more ease.  In my own experience, where my grandmother couldn't remember to hold a toothbrush, a Grip_Zz would have much improved the cleaning process of her mouth.  This is due to the nurses being able to gently use the Grip_Zz in the hands of the patient as they guide the tool around.  I Dearly wish my grandmother was still around, but I know if she was, the care gone into making a tool to extend her handle on daily objects would have greatly improved her attitude at some of the stages in her disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures:\\r\\n>Interior pressure tabs\\r\\n>Spoon\\/ Fork slot\\r\\n> safety ring\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment, this model is a rough version, ((Mach 1.) but I plan on updating it a bit every day with possible videos and new versions.

When I need an emergency heat pack, I fill a tube sock with rice, and microwave it. It's a perfect, quick solution for some relief- aside from one thing. It's ugly! So I made a cute cover that can hide the simple, no sew upcycle of a tube sock into a comfy heat pack. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis pattern includes lots of instructions for whatever kind of cover and pack you want to make. The covers are available in two sizes:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Large Cover holds two heat packs, and is about ten inches wide and ten inches long. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Small Covers hold one heat pack each, and 245 yards is plenty enough yarn to make two. This size is about 5 inches wide and ten inches long. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three ways to make the heat packs, including the no sew option, a one-seam option, and a fully sewn fabric option. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional supplies for this projects include:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Size H Hook\\r\\n- Size G Hook\\r\\n- Two tube socks (or a fat quarter of fabric with matching thread)\\r\\n- 2-3 cups of dry rice per heat pack\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional supplies:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Two matching buttons\\r\\n- Thread\\r\\n\\r\\nI love these covers because they protect your skin from the full heat of the rice packs, and they keep the rice hot for more time. \\r\\n\\r\\nGauge is not important for this pattern. Heavier weight yarn can be used, although it will block even more of the heat from getting through the heat pack. I find DK weight yarn to be the best suited for this. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome photos are included in the pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, the texture and design of the covers is meant to appeal specifically to hand dyed yarn. The covers only need about 100 grams of yarn (approx 245 yards), and the texture is meant to compliment the color changes that often come with hand dyed yarn.  Perfect for if you only have one skein of your favorite yarn!\\r\\n\\r\\nGive the finished product as a gift during the cold winter months, or give this pattern as a gift alongside some beautiful hand dyed dk yarn!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill not sure what to do with your most special hank of yarn?

Currently, we are developing Braille Bluetooth Keyboards that can either be part of a phone case for both Android and Apple smartphones or as a wallet sized standalone that can be connected to any Bluetooth enabled device like a tablet, phone, or computer to be used as a fully functional keyboard and navigation device.\\r\\nSmartphones are becoming increasingly empowering for the blind community: screen readers speak the contents of websites and e-books to readers, recent developments are enabling computers to generate descriptions of what is happening in an image, and speech recognition technologies are becoming better, allowing users to express themselves quickly online with text.\\r\\nBut speaking out what you want to type is not always appropriate, and it can be frustrating when it doesn't work well. What are the alternatives for fast typing on a smartphone as a blind user? You could carry around a large keyboard with you, buy an incredibly expensive refreshable Brailler, or use a specialized app with virtual buttons and then copy over the text to the original app: all unsatisfactory solutions. This is why we propose the BrailleTooth, a phone case with integrated Braille Bluetooth keyboard that lets blind users type quickly using physical buttons while maintaining a reasonable price point which is a fraction of the current Braillers on the market.\\r\\nThe problem our idea addresses is easier accessibility for the blind. The case provides a physical Braille keyboard on the back so that the visually impaired can type on their phones without needing the phone to tell them what key is under their finger. It is time-consuming for the visually impaired to type well using a touchscreen - we found a way to change that.\\r\\nHere is a video demonstration of our iPhone Brailler\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=4Mw84fKFbIw\\r\\n\\r\\n#ASSISTIVETECH\\r\\n\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"BrailleTooth -- Bluetooth Braille Keyboard\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/crochet-fidget-toys\",\"description\":\"This ebook provides three patterns to create crochet fidget toys including \\r\\nFidget Worry Worm\\r\\nFidget Octopus\\r\\nFidget Bumpy Ball\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCrochet fidget toys can be incredibly beneficial in various ways.

While you could just use rubberbands, duct tape, or someting else this design was made specifically with velcro strips in mind (as the slots on the lower piece indicate)  notacing that velco may be a pain for some people to get if anyone wants a design designed to be secured with duct tape or rubber bands or anything else (within reason please) just leave a comment saying what you want the modification to be and I will try to post a new one to those specifications asap. Also, I have done my best to make sure that there are no sharp points\\/ edges. But if there are any then either edit out the flaw or take some sandpaper to it (if it is less dramatic).\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: For this design to perform properly it will almost certainly need to be edited\\/ modified. This design is designed for a left hand and will need to be mirrored to fit a right hand. You will also probably need to print this several times (editing each time) to achive the best fit for your body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis design was made using SketchUp Make (free version)\\r\\n#AssistiveTech\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Wrist Brace for Assistive Technology Challenge\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/MaxwellBo\\/neoreader\",\"description\":\":speaker: A screenreader for Neovim.

I want thick soles that won\\u2019t easily wear out and can be worn alone or on top of socks. I want them to be fast and easy to make because if I wear them around the house a lot I know they will wear out.  The slippers are knit in one piece -- no seaming! \\r\\n\\r\\nMy slippers have a thick, slipped stitch sole, which is knit first. I don\\u2019t like to do garter stitch for this because I have princess and the pea feet and it is often uncomfortable to walk on garter stitch -- unless the wool is soft, but then it doesn\\u2019t last.  The construction is to knit the sole flat, then pick up around the edges of the sole using circular needles and\\/or DPNs, and knit the top upwards in the round.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**The PDF download is the August 2010 update**.  I\\u2019ve knitted quite a few of these slippers this summer to improve my design.  These are fitted slippers, and the number of stitches and rows you need depends on foot size and on the thickness of your yarn and needle size, so instead of describing the pattern stitch by stitch, I\\u2019ve tried to describe it in a way that will allow you to understand the construction and customize your slippers for your own desired fit.  A cardboard cutout of the outline of the foot you are fitting will make this easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse any yarn that is thick and strong.  I use super bulky yarn and 6.5mm needles.  I use different yarns for the sole and the top.  For the sole, I might use a nice super bulky yarn along with a strand of very strong sock yarn with a good amount of nylon for strength.  Or, I might use a strand of nice strong yarn along with a strand of Phentex Slipper and Craft Yarn, which is a very strong, almost indestructible acrylic.  You are only going to use this for the sole; for the upper part of the slipper you can select a nice super bulky yarn with exciting colours. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor man-sized slippers I use about 60 - 70 yards of each sole yarn, and about 70 - 80 yards of super bulky yarn for the slipper tops.  \\r\\n\",\"service\":\"ravelry\",\"name\":\"Big People Slippers\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/cane-handle-cover\",\"description\":\"This pattern is for a cover of a walking cane handle.

A mechanical braille embosser cost over a 1000$USD and an electronic goes from 3000$ up to 5000$. I tough about making one for a friend but I couldn't find a DIY version, so I decided to make one myself. This isn\\u2019t, by any means, a finish product. By making the machine an open source project, I am hoping others will improve the design. In a near future, with the help of others makers, OpenBraille will reduce the cost of these printers and it will allow anyone with a visual imparity to read and write. So, if you know someone, if you are a maker, if you are curious or if you want to help out, please feel free to follow this tutorial and help me built a community around OpenBraille.\\r\\nThe encoder is pretty much the heart of the embosser. Most of the commercial machines emboss the dots by impacting the sheet. Because it\\u2019s harder to build a precise machine out of 3D printed parts, I designed a different system. Instead of impacting and applying all the energy in a single hit, OpenBraille uses a physical encoder and a roller. This way, the embossing is gradually done and the parts can be easily printed.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=ocXuGkUpLOI&feature=youtu.be\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=qmcVlPqy9-o\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow the instructions at :\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.instructables.com\\/id\\/OpenBraille-a-DIY-Braille-Embosser\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook page:\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/OpenBraille-Braille-printer-in-OpenSource-109726986377498\\/\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"OpenBraille\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/hassaku\\/DS-and-ML-with-screen-reader\",\"description\":\"Data science and machine learning resources for screen reader users\",\"service\":\"github\",\"name\":\"DS-and-ML-with-screen-reader\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/hatemile\\/hatemile-for-java\",\"description\":\"HaTeMiLe is a library that can convert a HTML code in a HTML code more accessible.\",\"service\":\"github\",\"name\":\"hatemile-for-java\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/slouch-beanie-6\",\"description\":\"Pull on Hat - Knitting Pattern - fits Adults and Children.

His school started using an iPad to supplement his speech and looking at some of the prices for mounts out there, I decided I would create one!  \\n\\nThis mount would likely need to change depending on your wheelchair if you choose to use it, since piping may be a bit different.  The hole for the pipe is oversized as I used some rubber placemat material to wrap around the tube to prevent it from being scratched and it gave it an excellent grip!  The iPad is velcroed to the top plate, and seems to hold well!  \\n\\nThe gooseneck that I used is this one:  \\n\\nhttp:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Stage-Microphone-19-inch-Gooseneck-Black\\/dp\\/B00080KNG8\\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440721630&sr=8-1&keywords=On+Stage+Microphone+19-inch+Gooseneck%2C+Black&pebp=1440721632588&perid=0HFHHQBQQNKR42E9AP77  \\n\\nThe small hardware are standard 4-40 nuts and bolts.  The larger bolt for the gooseneck will vary depending on the gooseneck used and if you purchase an adapter or not.  \\n\\nWith the iPad on it, it seems to sag a bit, but it is manageable.  It will work until I find a stronger neck.  Something to note.. there is a difference between the US and UK style microphone goose necks.  Oddly, the US versions use a different thread pattern that you can't go to a hardware store (at least around here) and find hardware that will work with it.  I had to get adapters to make it work for me.  Also, the hole for the large bolt is not large enough for a socket.. purposefully did that so one has to use pliers to tighten it and ensures not to overtighten it.  A user can then unscrew the gooseneck from the top if you should need to fold up the wheelchair.  \\n\\nIt is not an elegant solution by any means... but it is my first real project created in CAD, so being a total n00b I am impressed with it! :)  Note: I apologize for the orientation...

Usually, most packers sold on the market are made out of silicone, which may not be an option for some, as it can sometimes be irritating, hot, sticky, heavy, expensive, etc. With this pattern, you can make your own packer and you can adjust the size, and the amount of stuffing to suit your needs. Overall, the materials can be found for more or less 15$, which makes it a great inexpensive alternative. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is knit top-down (starts at the tip and finishes with testicles), no seaming, with an opening flap to allow stuffing and de-stuffing for washing the packer when needed. The opening is created with the afterthought method. The skills required to make this pattern includes: knits & purl, cast-on & bind-off, increasing & decreasing, working small circumferences in the round on circular needles with magic loop, knitting flat, short rows, putting stitches on a lifeline, picking up stitches.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Materials Needed**\\r\\n**Yarn** used is Aunt Lydia\\u2019s crochet thread size 10, 100% mercerized cotton. You can use any size 10 cotton thread or smooth lace weight yarn that gives you the same gauge. I choose to use cotton fibers based on these recommendations; \\r\\n\\u2022\\tit is strong (mercerized cotton is stronger than regular cotton), so it will last longer. \\r\\n\\u2022\\tIt has less risks of allergies, which makes it a great choice for sensitive skin, and it is ideal if you are making it for someone that you don\\u2019t know. \\r\\n\\u2022\\tIt takes dye really well.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tSize 10 cotton thread is easy to find in most craft stores and is less expensive than most fibers.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will need around 137 to 183 meters of yarn (150 to 200 yards); plus a length of smooth scrap yarn in a contrasting color to insert lifelines.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Needles** Circular needles size US 0 \\/ 2 mm with a 50 cm (20\\u201d) cable or longer (as long as it\\u2019s long enough to do a magic loop).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Filling** can be polyester fibers or plastic pellets or flaxseeds. See recommendations at the end.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Dye**, if you want to dye your packer to make it more realistic-looking.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Dimensions** of the packer pictured: Length from the tip to the base is 9,5 cm (3,75\\u201d) and girth is 10 cm (4\\u201d).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Gauge is:\\r\\n40 stitches and 60 rows make 10 cm by 10 cm in stockinette stitch worked in the round.**\\r\\n\\r\\n**Updated (March 7, 2020): This new version (V2) has now instructions on how to add a foreskin !**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pattern has a light version (with 3 pictures, 8 pages); and another version with pictures at every step to guide you more easily through the pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am planning to write a tutorial on how to dye your packer to get realistic skin tones just as I did for the packer in the pictures. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Tips:**\\r\\n\\u2022\\tYou can put the stuffing in a nylon sock before filling the packer in order to prevent the material from poking through the knitted fabric. You can fill your packer with fiber stuffing, plastic pellets, rice or flaxseeds. Feel free to experiment!\\r\\n\\u2022\\tWhen knitting in the round with cotton, expect laddering! Cotton is not stretchy like wool. A way I\\u2019ve found to counteract laddering is to put the packer, once finished, 10-15 minutes in the drier. It will make the cotton stiffer and shrink a little bit, just enough to reduce the ladder, but be careful not to shrink it too much!\\r\\n\\r\\n**Wash and care:** Hand wash with delicate soap.

They can easily switch back and forth for different activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeveloped at the MAGIC ACT \\/ e-NABLE Lab at Rochester Institute of Technology, the Gripper Thumb TD has evolved over the past year to be effective for many two-handed tasks in much the same way as the voluntary opening split hook that has been used successfully for more than 150 years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe advantage over most other body-powered terminal devices is that the Gripper Thumb TD allows the user to grasp and release objects using the unaffected hand rather than a Bowden cable.  Pressing an object against the frictional surface of the thumb tip can force the thumb to be pulled away from the fingers for an object to be gripped.  Tasks with small objects (such as taking the nut off of a machine screw) or with large objects (such as opening and closing a jar, tube or bottle) can be undertaken this way.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter placing an object in the grasp of the Gripper Thumb TD, the unaffected hand can then be used to manipulate other objects such as putting toothpaste onto a toothbrush or cutting food with a knife while holding the item steady with a fork held in the Gripper Thumb TD. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother advantage over the traditional split hook is that the Gripper Thumb TD is considered by some people to be more attractive.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe gripping is provided by the force from a latex band, so it should not be used by people with allergies to such materials.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gripper Thumb TD can be washed with ordinary hand-washing and drying procedures, and it can even be sanitized in a dishwasher when fabricated of materials that can withstand that process.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe device is attached to the prosthesis with the bolt thread that is standard for th region (1\\/2 - 20 in the US, M12 fine-thread in most other places), and it can be easily exchanged with other terminal devices although the Bowden cable will not be used, and it can be removed or temporarily held out of the way with a rubber band.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe thumb pivots on a 6-32 (or M3) machine screw and a pair of similar screws hold the hex bolt in place on the device.  A flat washer is held in place on the bolt with the same type rubber ring that is used to provide the grasping force.  Between the flat washer and the prosthesis, the ring also provides frictional force that allows the Gripper Thumb TD to be rotated for pronation or supination by the unaffected hand, but holds the TD steady in the chosen orientation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe elastic ring is easily connected to the palm and to the thumb by a pair of zip-ties without tools (although a vise and pliers might be useful for one-handed assembly), and it can be easily replaced by clipping the zip-ties.  It should not be used by people who are allergic to latex.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Gripper Thumb Terminal Device\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thingiverse.com\\/thing:1471760\",\"description\":\"## What\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a low cost, printable AT button. It interfaces with any standard 3.5mm mono jack system, commonly found in support situations for people living with physical disabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAT buttons are a way for someone with a limited range of motion to control his or her environment at the same level as anyone else. These buttons can be used to adapt toys and home appliances such that they can be actuated with ease. Most AT buttons available are quite expensive, and are engineered to be used in serious -- 100% reliability -- situations. As a result there are a lot of [DIY projects](http:\\/\\/www.instructables.com\\/id\\/CD-Switch\\/) to make buttons meant for more relaxed use cases. We wanted to make a button that can be used for toy adapting and similar functions, while also providing a clean and durable design.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why\\r\\n\\r\\nThis button was created as part of a team-based senior design course. We worked with a local organization, [UCP and TASC of Huntsville](http:\\/\\/ucphuntsville.org\\/what-we-do\\/t-a-s-c\\/), to design and construct an AT keyboard and AT button.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking one button takes me about 8 hours of printing and 1 hour of assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Materials\\r\\n\\r\\n* [Cherry MX Switch](https:\\/\\/mechanicalkeyboards.com\\/shop\\/index.php?l=product_list&c=43)\\r\\n* [3.5mm Mono Port](http:\\/\\/smile.amazon.com\\/TOOGOO-Chassis-Female-Socket-Connectors\\/dp\\/B00EZIGTYY?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage)\\r\\n* 6\\\" or so of wire\\r\\n* Optional: [Compression spring](https:\\/\\/www.homedepot.com\\/p\\/Everbilt-Spring-Assortment-Kit-84-Pack-13554\\/203133714) for adjusting the button's actuation force.\\r\\n* Optional: [3.5mm Mono cable](http:\\/\\/www.mycablemart.com\\/store\\/cart.php?m=product_list&c=178) to connect the button to things\\r\\n* Optional: drawer\\/shelf\\/toolbox liner **or** dual-lock **or** velcro as a grip base\\r\\n\\r\\n### Assembly\\r\\n* Print the button base, button hatch, and and key cap.\\r\\n* Solder the MX switch to the mono port with two pieces of wire, about 3 inches each.\\r\\n* Install the MX switch in the middle of the button base, and then run the mono jack to the port on the flat side. Screw the mono port's threads into the hole in the side of the button.\\r\\n* Jam the key cap onto the cherry MX switch. This can optionally be done with a light spring over the switch stem to adjust the force of the button. \\r\\n* Optionally glue or bolt (M3 bolts) the shelf liner to the bottom of the button to make a no-slip base!\\r\\n\\r\\nCan also optionally have superglue to hold things together.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Doing Things With AT Button\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I'm just running through some small use cases that I've personally found for this button.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control a computer via an Arduino\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can use a [small firmware](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/ctag\\/cpe495\\/tree\\/master\\/button_test\\/button_test) on an arduino along with a [shell script](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/ctag\\/cpe495\\/tree\\/master\\/button_test\\/button_test) to automate tasks on your computer. In the example code the shell script uses xdotool to generate a Right arrow key press, which allows me to use the button to advance slides in a power point.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control a computer via microphone input\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also wire the button directly to a computer's microphone and detect button presses. This is still something we're looking into, and hope to return with more robust code.\\r\\n\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Adaptive\\/Assistive 3.5mm Button\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/cozy-kitty-heating-pad\",\"description\":\"Everyone loves a good heating pad, especially as we move into the colder months!

Dual DC Motor drivers - with or without Joystick control \\/ with or without Arduino.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  An Arduino and a couple of solid state relay boards (dual H Bridge) to drive the motors at 18V. \\r\\n\\r\\nSept 2016 - I got some new controllers to try out.  Thus far, the \\\"Cytron 10A 5-25V Dual Channel DC Motor Drivers\\\",  purchased from: http:\\/\\/www.robotshop.com\\/eu\\/en\\/10a-5-30v-dual-channel-dc-motor-driver.html  \\r\\nlook very promising indeed.  (Control option 1)\\r\\n\\r\\nThese controllers come with inbuilt \\\"test\\\" buttons - forward and backwards for each of the 2 motor channels.  \\r\\nThe test buttons can be wired directly to the switches on the legs, meaning there's no requirement for Arduino and coding, if simple control fits your needs.  \\r\\nHowever, they can still be interfaced to Arduino for more advanced control options if That's your requirement. \\r\\nThe Cytron boards also support joystick control - right out of the box!\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo control units will be required (one for each leg) but there is a pleasing simplicity to the (option 1) control layout. \\r\\nAn added benefit is that some protections are built in to the controller board  (against short circuits and so on) - so they're pretty robust.  So far - I'm very happy with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDual H Bridges (Control option 2)\\r\\nhttp:\\/\\/mg.elecrow.com\\/arduino-compatible\\/shield.html\\r\\nhttp:\\/\\/www.homotix.eu\\/product.php~idx~~~586~~locale~~~225~~Dual+Channel+H_Bridge+Motor+Shield+_8A+22V~.html\\r\\n\\r\\nChoose your own batteries - I'm using 18v Ni-Cd 'battery drill' batteries (Makita) for the testing - there's probably better choices for endurance, performance, size etc. out there.  For function testing - the drill batteries serve the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 20X20 aluminium extrusion provides multiple attachment points for linkages, batteries cover panels\\/enclosures etc. It is strong \\/ lightweight and readily available.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThigh Support files uploaded. - You may need to print them at 95% scale as the thigh support is right on printer limits for size (200X200X200).  If you have a square print bed - place them on the bed at 45 degree angle to maximise the print size.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote - All Leg supports are best printed at 100% Infill.\\r\\n\\r\\nI added a general purpose strap attachment point for the harness - for additional supports, back brace etc.  Can be attached where needed in your particular situation.  For back support -- Straps could be used from the hip motor mount, crossing at the chest and attaching to this clip at the mid point (top) of the back of the harness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arduino code is pretty raw, it's just to get the motors moving.  (For control option 2) but it does need more work.\\r\\nYou'll need the excellent driver that was created by Christoph Bober in order to use the .ino file - you'll find it on his site here: \\r\\nhttp:\\/\\/www.christophbober.com\\/?p=70\\r\\n(I just put the .h and the .cpp file in the same directory as the .ino but I believe there are more elegant ways to do it.)\\r\\nCurrently in the duino code - I have only 2 switches are controlling 2 motors.  There really needs to be 4 switch inputs. However, It provides a starting point from which to evolve your control solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started writing a build steps manual - I've uploaded a PDF of the build steps document at it's current state of completion.  Further updates expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn additional stiffener support is needed between the Hip_Harness_Attchmt and the Hip_Motor_Mount. A section of aluminium extrusion to act as a stiffener on the harness will ensure the hip motor movement transfers to the leg rather than causing the harness to crumple.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can use this project as a starting point, if you choose to implement voice control from a smartphone or inertial referencing - I won't try to stop you :o)  -- Just remember to share.\\r\\nFor those who need it, this is a quality of life thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI re-used some things I found on Thingiverse - modified them etc.  If you deserve credit for any work here please let me know. \",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Bot_Legs_Project (Exoskeleton)\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/twiddlemuff-4\",\"description\":\"Twiddlemuffs are easy-to-make hand muffs that are comforting and therapeutic for Alzheimer\\u2019s, arthritis and dementia patients.

The glove will send values from the Arduino and the potentiometer to the robotic arm and as a result, you would be able to control the robotic arm. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>While designing the glove and the arm we had the idea that instead of making the glove control an arm, the glove would be a portable Bluetooth keyboard that you will be able to use everywhere.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At the end we decided to make the keyboard and we called the project <strong>Hand Keyboard<\\/strong>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3><u>How the glove works:<\\/u><\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>On the back of the glove under the thumb and also under the index finger there are potentiometers that connect to the fingertips with a fishing wire. When you move your fingers the potentiometers rotate and send their values to the Arduino and then the Arduino transforms the signal to a character (depends on the values it received) and shows the output in the Arduino IDE - PC display, currently via the serial monitor, but in the future, we would like to do it wirelessly. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The potentiometers return to their 0 value thanks to the rubber band that is attached to the sensor with special parts we design.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The thumb act as a \\u201cshift\\u201d key that changes the letters that the index finger will be able to send.

I have news... sorta, in an engineering course I worked with a group of several students to improve this design and make it manufacturable. the improved design is more stable from a physics standpoint but doesn't use any 3D printed parts. I am working to adapt the design to a printable form factor and publish it online for all to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo these were created for a science fair project I did with the objective to try to develop several different types of drinking cups for people with parkinsons or suffer from a severe intention tremor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMy grandfather, who has a severe intention tremor, burned himself trying to drink coffee one day and thats what inspired me to create these cups.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI only had my printer for a month before the fair, so I did not get to develop these as much as I had hoped to. In a later version there may be orientation locks, turning limits (so you can actually drink from it), and more standardized weights.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHeres the catch, If I hear that any one of you makermen and women think that this is a great idea, and say so in the comments, then I will complete my designs for these cups more proactively.   \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the axis series I have developed two designs which, like the double gimbaled root beer holder by EricYoung (see remixed), use a twisting handle on a frame that pivots on an axis that goes thru the cup. both designs are incomplete.  \\r\\n>the first cup is a simple frame design with the central axis located above the center of the cup. 3 bearings are used  \\r\\n>the second cup is a bearing track design. This used 7 bearings.   \\r\\n\\r\\n-The handle design is based on the \\\"Hand steady\\\" cup (http:\\/\\/www.handsteady.com\\/) which allows a person to hold the apperatus in several differnt ways to reduce pottenial strain and twisting. When I finish the design there will be a turning limit with will allow the cup to rotate with the handle past a certain degree. Alternatively, on either design I may create a button, similar to EricYoung's design, that allows the cup to lock itself into place, except this will lock it into ANY orientation (particularly for the bearing track design)  \\r\\n\\r\\nMy fluid series: http:\\/\\/www.thingiverse.com\\/thing:277972  \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Experimental Anti-Hand Tremor Cups (axis series: 2 designs)\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/twiddlemuff-3\",\"description\":\"We've teamed up with Alzheimer's Society to bring you this Twiddlemuff - perfect for keeping dementia sufferers' hands calm.\",\"service\":\"ravelry\",\"name\":\"Twiddlemuff\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thingiverse.com\\/thing:1090096\",\"description\":\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=Ud5CIE_q-XU\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=di3E9-ii3n8\\r\\n\\r\\nSense Glove is an exoskeleton glove designed to force the hand closed or open based on the users input.

It could take a year or more to return to full functionality.   I printed the Black Ram Claw to bring some humor to their situation.  Then I started to wonder if it could provide basic practicality\\u2026 could it hold a jar while they opened a lid?    I found challenges:\\r\\n\\u2022\\tBeing above and in front of the hand is awkward for movement.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tThe holding pressure on most claws is in-adequate (for all ends)\\r\\n\\u2022\\tSlippery plastic is a challenge\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I started looking at prosthetic prints.  There is some insane work that has been done in this area.  They are largely designed for people that are missing an appendage.  So I decided to try to adapt one to the Black Ram Assembly.  It is a lot of pieces to get it to work well together.  Getting the assembly to generate enough power to overcome the pull resistance took some time.  After several pull designes,  I eventually reduced the pull pressure enough to where to where my wrist did not hurt using it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prosthetic does not solve all the problems.   I printed the end fingers in flex with the recommended high fill.  So its kind of like pla, with a more tactile touch.  The visual motion is great.  The hand sits pretty far out.  I did this to reduce it hitting a healing finger.  I was also trying to place the pull cord entry into the hand level with the Black RAM pull.   Unknowingly I removed the designed in leverage of the low pivot point in the original Prosthetic design.   Do to the nature of the Black RAM design, the hand is mounted fixed and the ram moves.  I did consider angling the hand down more.\\r\\n\\r\\nParts I am providing for the BLACK RAM ASSEMBLY:\\r\\n\\u2022\\tI cut the side off a screw so I can print a plate of them lying flat.  If I print them without supports I lose a little thread detail as I transition of the bottom.  Since they were PLA I printed them with support off the plate giving great threads all around.  Works great you can let them all print at once.  I used a .15 layer height.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tI designed Pins to replace the screws in places they don\\u2019t need screw tension and tend to fall out from the rotation.  The pins have nuts to just latch in place.   The 10mm short slots are probably best but a little harder to insert.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tThe Prosthetic Mount adapters for the RIGHT and LEFT hands (right hand not tested yet).\\r\\n\\u2022\\tA tensioning box to hold the prosthetic cords using tensioning_piece from the prosthetic hand design.  It is the same piece, I had to trim the knobs so they did not hit each other\\u2026 so the trimmed version is included.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tTension Box cover if I can get it to stay\\u2026 I spaced it with tape to prevent rattle\\u2026 this cover is optional.. once our hand cords are adjusted the tension will hold them in place.  Lift them so the top octagon clears the block and turn them to tighten.  Nice design Sonia.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tThe lever to pull the hand.  The lever requires two 688 bearings (16mm diam, 5mm wide, 8mm hole) or print the plastic SHIM I will provide to reduce the hole).\\r\\n\\u2022\\t8mm Pins for the new lever to go through the bearings.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tStub-Tendon to go in the lever\\r\\n\\u2022\\tFixed Tendon for the gauntlet port.   This is required to raise the pull position\\u2026 my first version was a tall fixed tendon.  I recommend the half height for improved leverage.\\r\\n\\u2022\\tThe gauntlet to lever tendon requiring 8mm pin on the lever side (top tendon).\\r\\n\\r\\nImprovements that I think could be made:\\r\\nBlack Ram Assembly\\r\\nThe joint between the gauntlet and the wrist assembly could use a conversion to a ball bearing.  That joint counters the pressure applied to the apparatus at the end.  While testing the prosthetic in its first version the pressure to close the hand was about 7 to 10 pounds (3.1 to 4.5kb) of pull.  I was bending the pins I had put in addition to the squeak.  It also made my wrist hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hooks are great but in the double claw you have too little leverage to keep the claw closed.  This is true for all the hooks.  There lots of ways to increase leverage at the end of the gripper such as a mod on this https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=YX1MsP7aRvo or one of the many other examples online that could be converted.\\r\\n\\r\\nProsthetic Observations\\r\\nI know nothing about Prosthetics.  These are my observations.  \\r\\n1)\\tCompounding the grip pressure at the tips to be able to hold things securely.  Maybe sleeving the channels through the hand with something like Teflon would reduce friction.  While I did not use the original wrist,  my hack could use some way to compound the pressure I apply to a significantly increased factor at the tips of the fingers.\\r\\n2)\\tIndependent suspension?  Slip differential?  The 5 fingers travel as a unit.  The first two to hit can prevent the others from making contact.  It was harder to pickup items with the fingers than the simple tri-claw.  How do we make each finger travel independently so the travel of the others is not interrupted\\u2026 and not compromise the overall grip?\\r\\n3)\\tA floating palm?  The fixed palm gives a surface to close against.  If the closing pressure of the fingers is increased and stabilized, could the palm apply additional counter pressure and close the grip on the object without releasing it from the fingers?  We are mimicking the hand, but we are not limited to what a hand can do if a feature adds benefit.\\r\\n4)\\tThe thumb.  School always taught us this is what differentiates humans from other species.   This mimics the two external joints, but the inside joint going to your wrist is what provides the real wrapping action in our thumbs and the closing pressure on the object to push it into the palm and the fingers.  I would see a requirement that the fixed assembly holding the current thumb design would need to move as well to close the grip.  This prosthetic model overall is missing a section in all the other fingers and therefore may be wrap challenged in some situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther files I am providing\\u2026 \\r\\nMy openscad hacks to make the parts.\\r\\nSeveral openscad files to cut the large parts for printing\\u2026 I then glued them back as suggested in this youtube video.  Made printing so much easier.  https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=stry5kibhyY&t=86s\\r\\n\\r\\nProsthetic assembly notes:\\r\\n10mm and 20mm long 2mm machine screws are too long and will need trimming in many holes.  I think I will prefer the piece of metal and seal it with filament.  I don\\u2019t know how that will work in the flex.. I tried melting some flex with an iron and it burnt at the same temp I do PLA with.  No science in that test though.  I was afraid a PLA plug would pop out of the flex.  The metal pieces save you money in bolts\\u2026 and no MICROSCOPIC nuts to come off\\u2026 glued or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started with nylon fishing wire.   Stranded is so much easier to work with.   I didn\\u2019t even tie it\\u2026 I just would the extra around the octagon fitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was actually my first flex print.  I have 5 incomplete fingers to prove it.   It took me that long to figure out the config I downloaded that was tuned by someone for flex on my Prusa MK3S still had retraction on\\u2026 at reduced settings, but the speed of the retraction was way too high.  The finger would get almost to the top and fail.. I assume there was more retraction required there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I print a hand body again I will print it with a bit more fill.  I can see it warping slightly under the strain of all 5 fingers pulling at once.   I likely did it at 20% for this one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to all the creators of these items.   In addition to working correctly right off the printer, they provided a great documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\n10\\/5\\/2021 Parts OPTION updates..\\r\\n\\r\\nI am going to publish a  LPTF (Low Profile Tuning Fork Version)\\r\\nThis simplifies the print and adds more 688 bearings to reduce friction at the start of a motion.   I cannot tell which is better as I am playing with a Flexy-Hand which gets really hard to pull as the FLEX joints close more.  Printing is more straight forward.   I have not put the SoniaVerdu's hand on this assembly yet to test the differences.  It will fit with no problem, but the octobox has a different connection\\u2026 and sits further from the hand so I would likely need to re-string to Sonia's hand to the new box.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not uploaded the scad files with the mods yet so if you need them message me an I will get on that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you don't have 688 bearings,  The library does have a spacer you can put in its place\\r\\nBlack-Ram-To_Prothetic_Adapter_688_8mm_center-hole_Bearing+FIller.stl\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you print the LPTF (Low Profile Tuning Fork Version)\\r\\nYou DO NOT need to print these parts\\r\\nBlack-Ram-To_Prothetic_lever_stub-tendon.stl\\r\\nBlack-Ram-To_Prothetic_Tensioning_octo_Block.stl\\r\\nBlack-Ram-To_Prothetic_fixed-HALF-tendon.stl \\r\\nBlack-Ram-To_Prothetic_fixed-TALL-tendon.stl \\r\\nBlack-Ram-To_Prothetic_Adapter_top_tendon.stl\\r\\nBlack-Ram-To_Prothetic_Tensioning_Cover.stl\\r\\nBlack-Ram-To_Prothetic_lever.stl\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead you will print these parts\\r\\nOption-LPTF-Black-Ram-To_Prothetic_Adapter_Octobox_cover_withcutout-Qty1.stl\\r\\nOption-LPTF-Black-Ram-To_Prothetic_Adapter_Octobox_withTendon-Qty1.stl\\r\\nOption-LPTF-Black-Ram-To_Prothetic_Adapter_SHORT_Fixed-Tendon-Qty1.stl\\r\\nOption-LPTF-Black-Ram-To_Prothetic_Adapter_Short_FlatLever_688-Bearings_Qty1.stl\\r\\nOption-LPTF-Black-Ram-To_Prothetic_Adapter_top-Tendon_Tuning-Fork-Version-Qty1.stl\\r\\nOption-LPTF-Qty1-Make_A_Pin_8mmx20-2.stl\\r\\nOPtional-Make_A_Pin_8mm_Nut.stl\\r\\nOptions_Explained.txt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNEW GAUNTLET OPTIONS:\\r\\nOriginal from the Black RAM library\\r\\nbrh5-gauntlet.stl\\r\\nbrh5-hand.stl\\r\\n\\r\\nor the 688 BALL BEARING version\\r\\nOption-688-brh5-gauntlet-Qty1-Pair-with-688-Bearing-Hand_8mm_Hole.stl\\r\\nOption-688-brh5-hand-Qty1-688-Bearing_8mm_Hole.stl\\r\\nOption-688-Hand-Qty2-Make_A_Pin_8mmx20-2.stl\\r\\n\\r\\nor the 688 BALL Bearing Versoin with the gauntlet printing as two parts you glue together.\\r\\nI smear a bunch of superglue on both surfaces in quick order... and clamp it together to dry for several hours.\\r\\nOption-688-brh5-gauntlet_side1-Qty1-GLUE-TOGETHER-Version-Pair-with-688-Bearing-Hand_8mm_Hole.stl\\r\\nOption-688-brh5-gauntlet_side2-Qty1-GLUE-TOGETHER-Version-Pair-with-688-Bearing-Hand_8mm_Hole.stl\\r\\nOption-688-brh5-hand-Qty1-688-Bearing_8mm_Hole.stl\\r\\nOption-688-Hand-Qty2-Make_A_Pin_8mmx20-2.stl\\r\\n\\r\\n \",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Adapters to attach Prosthetic Hand to Black Ram Mount and updated Pins\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/knotty-knockers\",\"description\":\"#BreastCancerAwarenessMonth\\r\\n\\r\\nThese crochet knockers are a great alternative to prosthetic breasts.

The thumb is a tube of ribbing that can be folded up or down. Great for commutes, chores, an evening out, or any time you need some mitten versatility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mitt features a horizontal stripe pattern in 2 colors of aran weight yarn. Some strategically placed slipped stitches form vertical stripes outlining the gusset and sides of the mitt. This is decorative, but also sneakily obscures the color jog at the start of each round that comes with knitting stripes in the round. Pattern includes complete written directions and charts of the palm and thumb gusset for each size. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Yarn:** 2 colors of aran weight yarn. Shown in Malabrigo Merino Worsted (210yds.\\/192m., 3.53oz.\\/ 100g.) (MC) 50 Roanoke and (CC) 27 Bobby Blue. For size M, I used about 1\\u20442 a skein for the MC and less than 1\\u20444 skein for the CC- a great project for leftovers!\\r\\n**Gauge:** 4.5 sts\\/in (18 sts\\/4in, 18sts\\/10cm).\\r\\n**Needles:** In size needed to get gauge. I used US 5\\/3.75mm DPNs.\\r\\n**Notions:** (Optional) Two lengths of thin ribbon or cord, 12-14 in\\/30.5-35.5 cm long, if you'd rather use it for drawstrings (instead of making your drawstring using I-cord, braiding, or single crochet).\\r\\n**Sizes:** 3 adult sizes. Circumference around palm of aprox. 7 in\\/18cm (Small), 8 in\\/20cm (Medium), 8.8 in\\/22cm (Large). Shown in size Medium. \\u201cCustomize\\u201d section includes information on altering size.\\r\\n**Skills:** Cast on, cast off, knit, purl, knit in the round on DPN's, M1 increase, YO increase, SSK decrease, K2tog decrease, slip stitches, place stitches on waste yarn\\/holder, pick up stitches. Optional: I-cord, single crochet, or braiding (for drawstring).\\r\\n**Accessibility Notes:** All charted sections also written, 12 point serif font with bolded and underlined headings, no columns (except for abbreviation key). Due to unusual drawstring construction (no drafts!), they may be particularly useful to those with circulatory problems (such as Raynauds), especially when used as an additional layer over gloves. \\r\\n\",\"service\":\"ravelry\",\"name\":\"Drawn Convertible Mitts\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/fidget-mitt\",\"description\":\"(Fran\\u00e7ais suivra)\\r\\n\\r\\n**What?** The basic Fidget Mitt crochet pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why?** I was once asked to custom-make a pair of these for a client who had a daughter with ADHD.

I will try to note everything about making of this project here as simple as possible. The idea of this has been ease of access, ease of building, and access to components anywhere. Hope this is an item you can build for anyone you know who is in need of them with basic ready-to-print 3D printers, such as Flashforge Finder and Adventurer. Cheap, strong, and fast to build. Code will be included so the best scenario is that you don't need to code the Arduino Nano at all yourself and just upload the code there with Arduino IDE software that is free on Arduino site.\\r\\n\\r\\nEMG sensor is probably the most expensive and hardest one to find cheap, but you can use your own judgment on that. In Ali Express and other Chinese stores, you can get a hold of these dry EMG sensors for about 40-50 euros\\/dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nItem's you will need to make this project are:\\r\\n\\r\\n-printed files, some sanding might be needed for all joints to be loose.\\r\\n-thin metal wire that goes through the finger joints and palm joint, I've used 1-2mm thick myself.\\r\\n-fishing line or fishing rope. I ended up using 90KG fishing rope as the 20KG servo motor ended up breaking 60KG fishing rope for some reason. I assume fish and motors are not the same. This is used to connect tip of the fingers to the servo arm.\\r\\n-elastic band, stronger is better if you can get your hands on it, but double or triple layer weak is enough also. This will be used to re-bounce fingers open when hold is toggled off.\\r\\n-15-20KG servo motor with metal arm and full metal gears. Plastic ones will break. I've used 20KG waterproof servos from Miuzei. These are cheap, strong and quiet. With 15KG motors I ended up having the servo struggle to hold grip on heavy objects.\\r\\n-batteries, I used battery packs made for RC cars as these come with usb chargers and are easy to hook up and charge. I used 2 x 6V 2400mAh soldered in Parallel so the voltage is 6V and mAh is 4800\\r\\n-rocker switch and 3 micro buttons. Rocker switch for power and micro buttons for locking feature and muscle reading value changing.\\r\\n-I2C led monitor is not necessary, but I decided to use one for convinience of knowing the value of muscle reading threshold and if the lock or open status in on. I used extremely cheap 0,9inch monitors or about 2cm x 1cm monitor.\\r\\n-EMG sensor with hopefully a dry sensor. Dry sensor is the small piece with 3 metallic sensors instead of needing the attachable medical ones. These can be found cheap on AliExpress. These have certain limitations, but for this project they work and are extremely affordable.\\r\\n-Arduino Nano. Official one is needed or third party that has exactly same power deliveries. I found my code and whole system running on third party Arduino Nano's or Arduino Nano clones not to function properly and having a lot of power dropping problems. Then I read about the power delivery differences in official and clone's data sheet. Included code in the .INO file is designed for the sensor that looks like the one in the pictures. This can be found easily in AliExpress and other online stores.\\r\\n-shunt resistor 1 ohm 5 watt. This will get a bit warm so get a good metalfilm one. You can also go higher, but code will be need a bit a of change as the analog read this is used to get signal of electricity will change.\\r\\n-jumper wires, small wires overall.\\r\\n-garden glove or work glove with a rubber\\/antislide inside of palm that fits over the finger\\/palm size you print.\\r\\n-wide velcro type strap, or you can use thin ones also and scale the model of 10cm wide velcro strap to your need. I found better thing to be luggage strap, but if you get to the point of this being decision, you for sure can make artistic decision.\\r\\n-electrical tape\\r\\n-hot glue\\r\\nIf when imported to slicing software, imported STL files are small, normal size is achieved by scaling 10x the stl in the slicing software. There are cubes as measurements in some of the STL files for 1cm scaling check inside the slicer. FPP files are Flashprint slicer files that you can print or export as STL or Gcode with free software called Flashprint. Flashprint lets you cut and slice objects to separate so you can separate printing pieces or item pieces to print. Flashprint is also used on Flashforge printers natively.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let's start the project, I try to cover everything in here in a simple matter and add pictures to the item that will help you follow. Though in most parts there's quite little room for error as I've tried to simplify the project and add angles that will make placing items wrong way hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst you'll have to print all the version 5 files and strap loops for velcro connections. I personally found best to use 10cm velcro strap and company it with 7,5cm velcro as there's two points of scale for the arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat job printing those pieces. You will be now getting your first other tools. Take metal wire and connect fingers to the palm and all fingers to each others. These should be so loose that it looks like a marionette and all fingers loosely shook everywhere when shaken. Now you can cut the elastic piece to a appropriate size so it goes over the joints of fingers. Position the hand palm down. This way fingers are loosely dragging on table. Drops of hot glue on finger joint and palm. Put the piece of elastic band in such a way that it's tight enough that it carries the finger up in the air straight. Repeat this until you have all fingers pointing straight when hand palm is pointing down, but the elastic bands are tight enough so fingers are not loose to that direction anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are now going to follow the wiring picture and wire everything as written and drawn down. If you decide to change connections places, remember to change them in the code also. Combine batteries in a line that you can drop inside the arm shield. After you have wired everything and power on the system, servo will rotate to it's default place, which would be close to open palm position. You can now disrupt the signal in the EMG sensor to get the servo move from A to B and then B to A. Also you can test your dry sensor out, remember that finding a position can be hard at first. Try it out and change the values of stiffness kovuus. What I often did before I knew my muscles and values, I put the muscle sensor on my arm where a muscle can be felt easily when flexed, IE bicep. When you keep your arm relaxed and hold the button to put kovuus to 0, servo will turn constantly from other end to other. Then add some value until it stops moving, this is your baseline movement in that muscle. Now the servo will probably move instantly when you move your arm as it's put on the very limit of flexing. Add more value until you are comfortable with the tension required.\\r\\n\\r\\nServo can be placed in couple different ways, to the top or to the side as in pictures shown.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow to the aligning of the metal arm on the servo. When you move the servo back and forth with your muscle. Look at the positioning and screw the servo arm in place when servo is on it's side and arm pointing down. This way the arm pulls towards your body when muscle is read to close the fist. You will get a good idea of this in the pictures about the servo positioning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen building the palm and wrist together, drill holes to both parts and put some metal rods if possible to the joint, this will give strength to the palm's and wrist's joint when Servo pulls the ropes through it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHot glue the servo in it's place and check that the arm moves properly before adding glue. Do the same for buttons and monitor which are in the top cover. Though depending if you have finalized the wiring and wires are already attached, you might first want to do the fishing rope stuff before attaching the cover shield to the wrist part.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlide rope through fingers to the servo arm. I found best way to calculate the fist and open hand length of rope to make a loop from rope to the servo arm. Then tie finger ropes to that loop. Tell the servo to move to the closed fist position and then tighten the ropes while holding the fingers in a closed fist which would be last position of them. Tie the ropes ends to the fingertips. This can be extremely frustrating process, helping hand from anyone is great here.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything should now be in pretty much at place. You can hot glue the battery cover to the wrist part and slide the dual battery inside, leaving power wire to the end for easy charging and putting power to the arm. Hot glue the arm cover on and velcro to the wrist and everything is starting to look pretty good.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor putting the glove. Cut the thumb separate from the glove and pull the glove on the 4 fingers first. Hot glue to the palm stopper and wrist shield and this will keep the glove tight on the fingers. Do the same for thumb.\\r\\n\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nFor audio readings it is pretty much the same approach, but with different code. Code will be included here. Main thing is to get the voice recognition module 3 and use it's own manual to record what ever commands you want there.\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Prosthetic arm with EMG or Audio control.

I am the owner of Beala Designs where part of my love is knitting and crocheting. This shawl was designed for a friend who spends much of her time in a wheelchair. She needed a shawl that was not as likely to get bunched up in the small of her back or pinned under her tush (hence the missing point in the back) as a traditional triangular shawl. A rectangular wrap would have solved that problem, but I also wanted a shape that would cuddle her effortlessly and not fall off her shoulders. I chose Dreambaby yarn because it is super snuggly and it can be machine washed and dried--very important for someone in a care facility. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pattern is worked from the bottom up making it very easy to adjust to suit any yarn weight and any size. Simply use the needle size recommended on the yarn label and stop knitting when the desired length is reached.

This is in the same way that Robotic grippers and end-effectors are designed for a specific goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Ram Hand is designed to help those with missing fingers or conditions such as Dupuytren's Contracture. It is wrist powered and requires that the wearer have enough palm to push against the device. It converts the rotation of the wrist into a linear sliding motion to activate the end gripper. When the wrist is bent down the slider pulls back, closing the hand. When the wrist is straightened the slider pushes forward and the hand opens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gripper heads are removable so that the user can change them and reconfigure the device to suit their needs. I have created 2 Claw types, Tri-Claw (for picking up or catching objects) and Two-claw (for open shut grasping of objects). New claw or manipulator types can be attached with 2 screws on the hand piece. Within these you can add any flavor of gripper suitable. I have added a few grippers as extras for people to try. I recommend that you start with the Simple Claw to get the feel of the device before printing the other variants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe multi-joint finger requires the user to tune the fingers. There is a sequence of loose and tight bolts that needs to be determined to allow for the correct articulation of the fingers when opening and closing. I recommend first using simple or pincer claws first as the multi-joint fingers take some tuning to get working correctly. \",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Black Ram Hand (Robotic\\/Prosthetic Hybrid) - Mark V\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/mrdcvlsc\\/analyse-pgn\",\"description\":\"A command line application that analyzes chess games in PGN file format\",\"service\":\"github\",\"name\":\"analyse-pgn\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thingiverse.com\\/thing:2899025\",\"description\":\"Update:- Uploaded files but forgot to short the name of the files but you may get some hints in the last name of the files.\\r\\nNote: it's still a work in progress and I have not yet made any assembly guide for more detail you can refer to the fusion file for assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove given are some of the picture of my final year project which is a multi-purpose Smart hands i.e it can acts as a telepresence Arm with a wear on controller or can be used as a Prosthetic Arm also can be used as a model.\\r\\nI am just uploading the picture coz I am not sure if the design is good and if someone needs the design but it was one of my 1st advanced level CAD designs which were done on Autodesk Fusion 360.

In Kindergarten, my eyesight began to decline rapidly and I had to start wearing some pretty powerful lenses very early on in my youth. My own mother experienced severe hearing loss while I was a young girl as well. So I easily identified with the visual and hearing impairment that Helen experienced. Her impairments were of course much more life changing than mine, but I always admired her for her determination to not let anything stop her from communicating with the world around her. She advocated strongly for the rights of the deaf and blind and she helped influence the spread of the use of Braille to help bring literacy to the blind.\\r\\nThis shawl is my tribute to Helen and the great things she accomplished. Did you know that she even knitted and crocheted when the weather was inclement? The small bobbles in the middle section are not just randomly placed. They are an accurate knitted representation of Braille.

This design has focused on a thicker and horizontally supported center post on the base to house the micro-switch as well as a sleeve built into the button that directs the button directly downward rather than allowing it to tip and get caught under the edge of the collar.  I've added a hole in the center bottom of the base for the insertion of a threaded insert.  I eliminated the mount for a headphone jack because it complicated the design and it's very hard to get the threaded collar of the jack to screw tightly enough to the plastic.  When looking at the video provided by atmakers they just stuck the cord through the hole anyway and didn't install a headphone jack.  I'm a big believer in putting a jack in the switch but I don't think this design lends itself to one.  I trialed multiple sleeve lengths and diameters in an attempt to find one that ensured that the button moved vertically with very little sway and thereby very little tendency to get caught under the collar.  The result is stable but comes with the washboard on washboard scraping sound and feel that is inherent in 3d printed sliding parts.  It might be possible to eliminate the rubbing by sanding down the surfaces.  I didn't bother.  I wish that I had experimented with swapping out filament colors when printing the base because it would have produced a nice \\\"bee\\\" look.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a hard time finding a good spring for the switch.  It needs to be 1 inch in length with a 1\\/2 inch outside diameter.  McMaster-Carr only had two springs that met this requirement and one of them was very hard to depress.

The video has done very well and opened up some unique opportunities for me including working with my local library to build controllers with kids to teach about electronics and coding. Recently I was emailed by a viewer who explained that he is unable to use his right hand due to a stroke. He expressed interest in developing a one-handed mouse system such that one could control WASD and other buttons in addition to normal mouse actions. I quickly began working during quarantine to develop this controller. Very simply it uses an arduino pro micro board, a joystick, and a few buttons to act as a usb game controller. With https:\\/\\/joytokey.net\\/en\\/ software the control inputs are mapped to specific keys. To create the code for this project one must download the arduino joystick library by Matthew Heironimus at https:\\/\\/github.com\\/MHeironimus\\/ArduinoJoystickLibrary. Originally the base of the controller had a thin platform on which the mouse rested. However, I found that some mice needed to make full contact with the table surface to function properly. As a result, I created a base version without this thin raised platform. If your mouse only works when making full contact with your mouse pad or desk, use this bottomless version.

If the pattern is followed exactly and gauge is met, the finished dimensions are:\\r\\nUpper cuff 10 inches circumference unstretched\\r\\nLower cuff 7.5 inches circumference unstretched at bottom edge, 8.75 inches unstretched at upper edge before stockinette section\\r\\nTotal length 13.25\\r\\n \\r\\nGauge is not super critical if you are able to have your recipient try on as you go, but I do suggest a swatch anyway so you know how many stitches to cast on. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: http:\\/\\/aroundnround.blogspot.com\\/2008\\/10\\/free-pattern-arm-warmer-for-dialysis.html?m=1\\r\\n  [2]: https:\\/\\/www.twincitieslive.com\\/fun\\/35527\\/knit-y-gritty-knitters\\/\",\"service\":\"ravelry\",\"name\":\"Dialysis sleeve\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/stretchy-ear-protector-for-face-mask\",\"description\":\"**Stretchy Ear Protector Strap for Face Mask**\\r\\nWear this Stretchy ear protector and feel comfortable with your face mask.

They do this by physically separating access to specific regions of the tablet screen with rails that rise up from the surface of the tablet.  In this case, the apps are associated with Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).\\r\\n\\r\\nSome AAC apps organize their content into grids with menus and message bars, above or below the grid.  Others are much more creative and unpredictable in their layouts.  Hybrid apps are largely grid-based but their keyguards can be enhanced by selectively exposing specific regions of the app.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of possible choices for tablet, tablet case, and AAC app, make it impossible to design a few keyguards that will meet everyone's needs.  To complicate matters further, users have lots of flexibility for how they organize the content in their apps.  All of this is to say that users must be given control over the keyguard design.  I know of only one 3D modeling tool where that is possible - without requiring that each user become an expert in 3D modeling.  That tool is OpenSCAD.  OpenSCAD has a \\\"Customizer\\\" feature that allows users to provide input to an OpenSCAD design that can shape the design to meet their specific needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have created an OpenSCAD designer that allows the user to  identify their tablet, describe how the AAC app is laid out, describe their case, and choose a mounting method to mount the keyguard directly to the tablet or to the case.  Once the keyguard is fully described you can generate and save an STL file that you can print on your 3D printer.\\r\\n\\r\\nA PDF form is provided as well for collecting and communicating the requirements for your keyguards.\",\"service\":\"thingiverse\",\"name\":\"Customizable, 3D-Printable Keyguard for Grid-based, Free-form, and Hybrid AAC Apps on Tablets\"},{\"index\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ravelry.com\\/patterns\\/library\\/toe-sockies-for-casts\",\"description\":\"Toe only (no heel), tie-on half-sock for people stuck in leg casts with exposed toes.

Over that period, we have made continuous incremental improvements to the design based on recipient feedback. The Kinetic Hand is a body powered device, and is designed to be used by people with congenital hand differences, with a functioning wrist to open and close the fingers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kinetic Hand design is being released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) open-source license to encourage further innovation in this field, and improve global access to assistive technology. \\r\\nThis design is released for trial and evaluation purposes only, and is intended to benefit certain individuals with specific hand differences and is not intended, and shall not be used, for commercial purposes.\\r\\nThe acceptance of this design by Free 3D Hands Ltd, and any such information provided by the design team is presented as is without representation or warranties of any kind, express or implied, and is intended to be a free gift to recipients for the sole purpose of evaluating various design iterations, ideas and modifications. The Kinetic Hand must be used for only light tasks such as picking and placing of small objects, and not for any tasks that could be considered dangerous.  Any individual associated with Free 3D Hands Ltd shall not be liable for any injuries or damages resulting from the use of any information or designs provided. The Kinetic Hand is experimental, is not classified as a medical device, and is for evaluation purposes only. In some cases, these devices will not be appropriate for each individual, and consultation with medical professionals and occupational therapists must be sought and obtained before use.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesign Merits:\\r\\n\\r\\nSilent Operation\\r\\nThe flexible hinges are designed to prevent any contact between rigid parts, allowing for silent operation of the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoulded Silicone Finger Grips\\r\\nUsing a scalable 3D printed mould, grippy silicone finger grips allow the fingers to better grip a wide range of objects. This also eliminates the need to use consumer products such as Lee Tippi Micro-Gel finger grips which are hard to source, expensive and limited to only a few sizes. \\r\\n\\r\\nSplit Hinges\\r\\nThe hinges are designed to fit from one side, and stretch fit from the other. This prevents the hinge from sliding out laterally. Hinges do not require any glue, and provide an ideal amount of elasticity to open the fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDual Tendons \\r\\nThe need to tie tendons in the fingers has been eliminated, with tendons looping back through the fingers and hand being tied only once at the tensioner.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlexible Tensioners\\r\\nThe tensioners are made from an elastic material to allow individual fingers to come to a close while the other fingers continue to travel. There is no inter-connection between fingers, allowing for even grip distribution on a wide range of different object shapes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart Numbering\\r\\nAll of the finger parts, hinges and grips are individually numbered to assist during assembly, ensuring correct part position and orientation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for Partial Thumb\\r\\nBy optimising wall thicknesses and tendon routing, we have created additional space inside the Palm cavity to allow for a partial thumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlexible Palm Cover\\r\\nThe flexible Palm Cover improves comfort for the user, since this is where all of the force is applied during use. It can also stretch to help when inserting the partial hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustable Tensioner Positions\\r\\nTensioner positions can be adjusted under the Gauntlet Cover to allow individual finger open and close positions to be incrementally adjusted to suit individual preference.\\r\\n \\r\\nProtective Gauntlet Cover\\r\\nTensioners and tendon knots are protected by the Gauntlet Cover to improve durability and prevent damage. \\r\\n\\r\\nImproved Scalability\\r\\nThe Kinetic Hand has been tested successfully between scales of 50% and 100% of the CAD model, which is designed at the scale of a large adult.

Large figurative elements such as monumental sculpture and their equivalents in decorative art are excluded from the term; most ornament does not include human figures, and if present they are small compared to the overall scale. Architectural ornament can be carved from stone, wood or precious metals, formed with plaster or clay, or painted or impressed onto a surface as applied ornament; in other applied arts the main material of the object, or a different one such as paint or vitreous enamel may be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18th-century Rococo balcony, Bavaria. The form is itself ornamental, and further decorated in painted plasterwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nArabesque ornament on a Turkish dagger hilt\\r\\nA wide variety of decorative styles and motifs have been developed for architecture and the applied arts, including pottery, furniture, metalwork. In textiles, wallpaper and other objects where the decoration may be the main justification for its existence, the terms pattern or design are more likely to be used. The vast range of motifs used in ornament draw from geometrical shapes and patterns, plants, and human and animal figures. Across Eurasia and the Mediterranean world there has been a rich and linked tradition of plant-based ornament for over three thousand years; traditional ornament from other parts of the world typically relies more on geometrical and animal motifs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1941 essay,[1] the architectural historian Sir John Summerson called it \\\"surface modulation\\\". The earliest decoration and ornament often survives from prehistoric cultures in simple markings on pottery, where decoration in other materials (including tattoos) has been lost. Where the potter's wheel was used, the technology made some kinds of decoration very easy; weaving is another technology which also lends itself very easily to decoration or pattern, and to some extent dictates its form. Ornament has been evident in civilizations since the beginning of recorded history, ranging from Ancient Egyptian architecture to the assertive lack of ornament of 20th century Modernist architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrnament implies that the ornamented object has a function that an unornamented equivalent might also fulfill. Where the object has no such function, but exists only to be a work of art such as a sculpture or painting, the term is less likely to be used, except for peripheral elements. In recent centuries a distinction between the fine arts and applied or decorative arts has been applied (except for architecture), with ornament mainly seen as a feature of the latter class.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nContents\\r\\n1\\tHistory\\r\\n2\\tOrnament prints and pattern books\\r\\n3\\tModern ornament\\r\\n4\\tSee also\\r\\n5\\tNotes\\r\\n6\\t19th-century compendiums of ornament\\r\\n7\\tReferences\\r\\nHistory\\r\\n\\r\\nMing dynasty Jingdezhen porcelain dish with dragon\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthern Mannerist architectural pattern book by Wendel Dietterlin, 1598\\r\\n\\r\\nIslamic geometrical ornament on an Egyptian door\\r\\n\\r\\nKhmer lintel in Preah Ko style, late 9th century, reminiscent of later European scrollwork styles\\r\\n\\r\\nDecorative patterns on a tower of the Karim Khan Citadel, Iran\\r\\nThe history of art in many cultures shows a series of wave-like trends where the level of ornament used increases over a period, before a sharp reaction returns to plainer forms, after which ornamentation gradually increases again. The pattern is especially clear in post-Roman European art, where the highly ornamented Insular art of the Book of Kells and other manuscripts influenced continental Europe, but the classically inspired Carolingian and Ottonian art largely replaced it. Ornament increased over the Romanesque and Gothic periods, but was greatly reduced in Early Renaissance styles, again under classical influence. Another period of increase, in Northern Mannerism, the Baroque and Rococo, was checked by Neoclassicism and the Romantic period, before resuming in the later 19th century Victorian decorative arts and their continental equivalents, to be decisively reduced by the Arts and Crafts movement and then Modernism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detailed study of Eurasian ornamental forms was begun by Alois Riegl in his formalist study Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik (Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament) of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the Kunstwollen.[2] Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from Ancient Egyptian art and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the arabesque of Islamic art. While the concept of the Kunstwollen has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider corpus of examples known today.[3] Jessica Rawson has recently extended the analysis to cover Chinese art, which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the Mongol invasion harmonious and productive.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nStyles of ornamentation can be studied in reference to the specific culture which developed unique forms of decoration, or modified ornament from other cultures. The Ancient Egyptian culture is arguably the first civilization to add pure decoration to their buildings. Their ornament takes the forms of the natural world in that climate, decorating the capitals of columns and walls with images of papyrus and palm trees. Assyrian culture produced ornament which shows influence from Egyptian sources and a number of original themes, including figures of plants and animals of the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Greek civilization created many new forms of ornament, with regional variations from Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian groups. The Romans Latinized the pure forms of the Greek ornament and adapted the forms to every purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrnament prints and pattern books\\r\\n\\r\\nOrnament print by Sebald Beham, Centaurs fighting with mounted men.\\r\\n\\r\\nElaborated versions of Greco-Roman classical architectural ornaments in Meyer's Ornament\\r\\n\\r\\nA detail from the margin of a page of a Late Gothic manuscript\\r\\nA few medieval notebooks survive, most famously that of Villard de Honnecourt (13th century) showing how artists and craftsmen recorded designs they saw for future use. With the arrival of the print ornament prints became an important part of the output of printmakers, especially in Germany, and played a vital role in the rapid diffusion of new Renaissance styles to makers of all sorts of object. As well as revived classical ornament, both architectural and the grotesque style derived from Roman interior decoration, these included new styles such as the moresque, a European adaptation of the Islamic arabesque (a distinction not always clear at the time).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs printing became cheaper, the single ornament print turned into sets, and then finally books. From the 16th to the 19th century, pattern books were published in Europe which gave access to decorative elements, eventually including those recorded from cultures all over the world. Andrea Palladio's I quattro libri dell'architettura (Four Books on Architecture) (Venice, 1570),[5] which included both drawings of classical Roman buildings and renderings of Palladio's own designs utilizing those motifs, became the most influential book ever written on architecture. Napoleon had the great pyramids and temples of Egypt documented in the Description de l'Egypte (1809). Owen Jones published The Grammar of Ornament in 1856 with colored illustrations of decoration from Egypt, Turkey, Sicily and Spain. He took residence in the Alhambra Palace to make drawings and plaster castings of the ornate details of the Islamic ornaments there, including arabesques, calligraphy, and geometric patterns. Interest in classical architecture was also fueled by the tradition of traveling on The Grand Tour, and by translation of early literature about architecture in the work of Vitruvius and Michelangelo.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, the acceptable use of ornament, and its precise definition became the source of aesthetic controversy in academic Western architecture, as architects and their critics searched for a suitable style. \\\"The great question is,\\\" Thomas Leverton Donaldson asked in 1847, \\\"are we to have an architecture of our period, a distinct, individual, palpable style of the 19th century?\\\".[6] In 1849, when Matthew Digby Wyatt viewed the French Industrial Exposition set up on the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es in Paris, he disapproved in recognizably modern terms of the plaster ornaments in faux-bronze and faux woodgrain:[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth internally and externally there is a good deal of tasteless and unprofitable ornament... If each simple material had been allowed to tell its own tale, and the lines of the construction so arranged as to conduce to a sentiment of grandeur, the qualities of \\\"power\\\" and \\\"truth,\\\" which its enormous extent must have necessarily ensured, could have scarcely fail to excite admiration, and that at a very considerable saving of expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nContacts with other cultures through colonialism and the new discoveries of archaeology expanded the repertory of ornament available to revivalists. After about 1880, photography made details of ornament even more widely available than prints had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern ornament\\r\\nModern millwork ornaments are made of wood, plastics, composites, etc. They come in many different colours and shapes. Modern architecture, conceived of as the elimination of ornament in favor of purely functional structures, left architects the problem of how to properly adorn modern structures.[8] There were two available routes from this perceived crisis. One was to attempt to devise an ornamental vocabulary that was new and essentially contemporary. This was the route taken by architects like Louis Sullivan and his pupil Frank Lloyd Wright, or by the unique Antoni Gaud\\u00ed. Art Nouveau, for all its excesses, was a conscious effort to evolve such a \\\"natural\\\" vocabulary of ornament.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more radical route abandoned the use of ornament altogether, as in some designs for objects by Christopher Dresser. At the time, such unornamented objects could have been found in many unpretending workaday items of industrial design, ceramics produced at the Arabia manufactory in Finland, for instance, or the glass insulators of electric lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis latter approach was described by architect Adolf Loos in his 1908 manifesto, translated into English in 1913 and polemically titled Ornament and Crime, in which he declared that lack of decoration is the sign of an advanced society. His argument was that ornament is economically inefficient and \\\"morally degenerate\\\", and that reducing ornament was a sign of progress.[9] Modernists were eager to point to American architect Louis Sullivan as their godfather in the cause of aesthetic simplification, dismissing the knots of intricately patterned ornament that articulated the skin of his structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the work of Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus through the 1920s and 1930s, lack of decorative detail became a hallmark of modern architecture and equated with the moral virtues of honesty, simplicity, and purity. In 1932 Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock dubbed this the \\\"International Style\\\". What began as a matter of taste was transformed into an aesthetic mandate. Modernists declared their way as the only acceptable way to build. As the style hit its stride in the highly developed postwar work of Mies van der Rohe, the tenets of 1950s modernism became so strict that even accomplished architects like Edward Durrell Stone and Eero Saarinen could be ridiculed and effectively ostracized for departing from the aesthetic rules.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, the unwritten laws against ornament began to come into serious question. \\\"Architecture has, with some difficulty, liberated itself from ornament, but it has not liberated itself from the fear of ornament,\\\" John Summerson observed in 1941. [10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very difference between ornament and structure is subtle and perhaps arbitrary. The pointed arches and flying buttresses of Gothic architecture are ornamental but structurally necessary; the colorful rhythmic bands of a Pietro Belluschi International Style skyscraper are integral, not applied, but certainly have ornamental effect. Furthermore, architectural ornament can serve the practical purpose of establishing scale, signaling entries, and aiding wayfinding, and these useful design tactics had been outlawed. And by the mid-1950s, modernist figureheads Le Corbusier and Marcel Breuer had been breaking their own rules by producing highly expressive, sculptural concrete work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe argument against ornament peaked in 1959 over discussions of the Seagram Building, where Mies van der Rohe installed a series of structurally unnecessary vertical I-beams on the outside of the building, and by 1984, when Philip Johnson produced his AT&T Building in Manhattan with an ornamental pink granite neo-Georgian pediment, the argument was effectively over. In retrospect, critics have seen the AT&T Building as the first Postmodernist building.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nBronze and brass ornamental work\\r\\nBrocade\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\tWikimedia Commons has media related to Ornaments.\\r\\n\\r\\n Summerson, John (1941) printed in Heavenly Mansions 1963, p. 217\\r\\n Tabbaa, 74-75\\r\\n Rawson, 24-25; see also \\\"\\u201cStyle\\u201d\\u2014or whatever\\\", J.

After all, if where we live, flowers bloom luxuriously, vegetables ripen and chickens lay eggs-then this is a healthy environment in which it is not terrible to raise children and exist yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first urban farms began to open in England, Scandinavia and America, there came a realization that it is necessary to look at our cities from a different point of view. For the cultivation of edible fruits and plants need bees (one-third of all agricultural products of the planet is produced by pollination), for the destruction of harmful insects-bats: one individual eats up to 10 million parasites per year-a highly environmentally friendly replacement for harmful pesticides.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial conditions are also required for chickens, which in a sense are ideal companions for us: the chicken destroys food waste, and in return carries eggs, one daily-just the daily rate of one person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWooden bee hives on the roofs of city buildings.

To help with this, we have designed an open-source, 3D printed, refreshable Braille display which can be made for less than $200.  \\nBased on the premise of sliding bars with bumps to raise the dots, the bars are moved by small pager motors with worm gears (such as http:\\/\\/www.robotshop.com\\/solarbotics-tiny-pager-motor-tpm2.html).  An Arduino will control the motors and receive feedback from a small resistive element in the center which will serve as a position sensor.  \\nThe current design as posted is fully printable, but only functional manually.  \\nModifications which still need to be made:  \\n-resistance sensor and contact pocket need to be added.  Ideas include printed circuit boards, graphite rods (pencil lead) and ideally a conductive ABS filament (such as http:\\/\\/rainbot3d.com\\/product_info.php?products_id=71) printed part which would be printed using a dual extrusion printer in-situ.  \\n-Gear system needs to be upgraded.  Currently the worm gear direct drive to the bar requires too much torque for the small pager motor.  Adding a large spur gear with an axially attached smaller spur gear to reduce the required torque may be necessary.  Alternatively, a motor with more torque such as (http:\\/\\/www.robotshop.com\\/solarbotics-gm15-gear-motor.html) may work.  \\nOur Teams Mission Statement is:  \\nTo leverage advances in materials research and manufacturing to reduce the cost and complexity of Refreshable Braille Displays to promote greater literacy in the blind and visually impaired community.  \\nDesign is fully parametric in OpenSCAD (although there are some issues with using the scale feature at the moment, to be fixed in the future).  \\nOriginal idea for control mechanism from:   \\nhttp:\\/\\/www.kscitech.com\\/BBT\\/Slider_diagram1.jpg  \\n8\\/31\\/13 Update:  \\nAdded a sketch of a modified design incorporating a dual spur gear to improve the gearing of the mechanism.
