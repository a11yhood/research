# translation notes

collections of links at the intersection of translation and accessibility.

## TLDR

* `aria-label` still stinks, use `aria-labelledby` or you're in for a world of hurt. same goes for `aria-description` which uses the [accName heuristics](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.2/).
* translation will cause text problems spacing and display inaccessibilities if not handled correctly
  * [<ruby><code>a11y.css</code><rt>alix</rt></ruby>](https://ffoodd.github.io/a11y.css) is an interesting end user solution especially for authoring content
* gettext, po, mo are old school and there are new frameworks. there are new options
  * can these techniques apply to text simplification, [accessible numbers](https://accessiblenumbers.com/), maybe even braille?
  * we'll need to understand new syntaxes for translation
* a11y documentation is an exhausting hunting and gathering simulation. my fingers are legs cramped from gathering a11y resources strewn across the vast wasteland of post modernities recklessness. 
did i just create more waste with this document?
