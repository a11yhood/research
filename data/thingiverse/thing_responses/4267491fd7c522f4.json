The **default is Thin** (.8mm) as supplied by **SparkFun Electronics**.

There are now 12 file options: **small, med and large** each with a choice of **convex or concave button** style.

This version uses a very small **\"Lilypad Button Board\"** with low activation force and capable of signal level switching, \r\n\r\nThis three part enclosure (no screws) makes a small momentary tactile button switch more durable and accessible by providing protection and a larger activation surface. Designed with **OpenSCAD**, this parametric design allows selecting the build diameter, base style (plain or strap mounting) and button style (recessed or protruding). STL files for the small, medium and large sizes are provided for convenience. For other options use the **Customizer**. Make sure the custom diameter setting matches each of the three parts saved to insure they fit together. This version features a threaded latch and uses **radial flexures** for frictionless activation.

The default is Lo but Hi force will increase the activation force by approximately 66 grams force for the 35mm switch.<\/li><li>Since the <strong>LilyPad Button Board<\/strong> is available in two PCB thicknesses I added an option for <strong>Thin or Thick<\/strong>. The <strong>default is Thin<\/strong> (.8mm) as supplied by <strong>SparkFun Electronics<\/strong>. However the <strong>Thick<\/strong> setting will change the base part standoff height to accommodate a 1.6mm PCB thickness (as found on Amazon and elsewhere in the internet). <\/li><li>Since <strong>Thingiverse Customizer<\/strong> is still unreliable, I have posted <strong>more STL file options<\/strong> to make it easier to download the  size and button style you prefer. There are now 12 file options: <strong>small, med and large<\/strong> each with a choice of <strong>convex or concave button<\/strong> style. Of course you can still download the <strong>OpenSCAD source file<\/strong> and open it in the OpenSCAD application to use the built-in customizer for access to all the parameters.<\/li><\/ul><h3><strong>DIYAT Switch V4 Specifications:<\/strong><\/h3><ul><li><strong>Switching capacity:<\/strong> 1 to 50 mA, 5 - 24 VDC (resistive load)<\/li><li><strong>Activation surface:<\/strong> approximately 199 - 1655 square mm (smallest to largest outside diameter parameter)<\/li><li><strong>Activation force:<\/strong> approximately 204 - 248 grams force (largest to smallest outside diameter parameter; measured with digital scale near center of button; less force required with larger button due to mechanical advantage)<\/li><li><strong>Activation distance:<\/strong> approximately 0.25 mm (as per SparkFun Mini Pushbutton Switch - SMD specifications)<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Discription<\/strong><br>This is a simple passive <strong>Do It Yourself Assistive Technology<\/strong> switch enclosure similar to <strong>DIYAT V5<\/strong> (<a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"\/thing:3146646\">https:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:3146646<\/a>). The major difference is the switch used in the enclosure.

Designed with <strong>OpenSCAD<\/strong>, this parametric design allows selecting the build diameter, base style (plain or strap mounting) and button style (recessed or protruding). STL files for the small, medium and large sizes are provided for convenience. For other options use the <strong>Customizer<\/strong>. Make sure the custom diameter setting matches each of the three parts saved to insure they fit together. This version features a threaded latch and uses <strong>radial flexures<\/strong> for frictionless activation. Although it is frictionless, there is resistance from the flexures which increases the activation force slightly. Here's how the flexure works: <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2EqkSfG4u5U\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/2EqkSfG4u5U<\/a><\/p><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> the switch used in this design is good for signal level switching (loads under 50mA) as is the case for any AT switch based on a PCB style tactile switch.
