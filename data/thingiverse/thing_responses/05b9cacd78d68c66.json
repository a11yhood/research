Dual DC Motor drivers - with or without Joystick control \/ with or without Arduino.\r\n\r\n2.  An Arduino and a couple of solid state relay boards (dual H Bridge) to drive the motors at 18V. \r\n\r\nSept 2016 - I got some new controllers to try out.  Thus far, the \"Cytron 10A 5-25V Dual Channel DC Motor Drivers\",  purchased from: http:\/\/www.robotshop.com\/eu\/en\/10a-5-30v-dual-channel-dc-motor-driver.html  \r\nlook very promising indeed.

So far - I'm very happy with them.\r\n\r\nDual H Bridges (Control option 2)\r\nhttp:\/\/mg.elecrow.com\/arduino-compatible\/shield.html\r\nhttp:\/\/www.homotix.eu\/product.php~idx~~~586~~locale~~~225~~Dual+Channel+H_Bridge+Motor+Shield+_8A+22V~.html\r\n\r\nChoose your own batteries - I'm using 18v Ni-Cd 'battery drill' batteries (Makita) for the testing - there's probably better choices for endurance, performance, size etc. out there.  For function testing - the drill batteries serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe 20X20 aluminium extrusion provides multiple attachment points for linkages, batteries cover panels\/enclosures etc. It is strong \/ lightweight and readily available.\r\n\r\n\r\nThigh Support files uploaded. - You may need to print them at 95% scale as the thigh support is right on printer limits for size (200X200X200).  If you have a square print bed - place them on the bed at 45 degree angle to maximise the print size.\r\n\r\nNote - All Leg supports are best printed at 100% Infill.\r\n\r\nI added a general purpose strap attachment point for the harness - for additional supports, back brace etc.  Can be attached where needed in your particular situation.  For back support -- Straps could be used from the hip motor mount, crossing at the chest and attaching to this clip at the mid point (top) of the back of the harness.\r\n\r\nThe Arduino code is pretty raw, it's just to get the motors moving.  (For control option 2) but it does need more work.\r\nYou'll need the excellent driver that was created by Christoph Bober in order to use the .ino file - you'll find it on his site here: \r\nhttp:\/\/www.christophbober.com\/?p=70\r\n(I just put the .h and the .cpp file in the same directory as the .ino but I believe there are more elegant ways to do it.)\r\nCurrently in the duino code - I have only 2 switches are controlling 2 motors.  There really needs to be 4 switch inputs. However, It provides a starting point from which to evolve your control solution.\r\n\r\nI started writing a build steps manual - I've uploaded a PDF of the build steps document at it's current state of completion.  Further updates expected.\r\n\r\nAn additional stiffener support is needed between the Hip_Harness_Attchmt and the Hip_Motor_Mount. A section of aluminium extrusion to act as a stiffener on the harness will ensure the hip motor movement transfers to the leg rather than causing the harness to crumple.\r\n\r\nYou can use this project as a starting point, if you choose to implement voice control from a smartphone or inertial referencing - I won't try to stop you :o)  -- Just remember to share.\r\nFor those who need it, this is a quality of life thing.\r\n\r\nI re-used some things I found on Thingiverse - modified them etc.  If you deserve credit for any work here please let me know.
