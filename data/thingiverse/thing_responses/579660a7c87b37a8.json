I've made most of it parametricly relying heavily off the dimension of the pill bottle, hopefully I can learn openscad in time to try making a customizer version.<\/p><p>In the second mockup I changed to a handle design based off of feedback that some disabled people may not be able to grasp their hand all the way, however it would be possible for them to still use a lever. Another small experimental feature I added was a second ring inside for tackling smaller pill bottle caps.<\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/2d\/13\/30\/63\/ec\/medication_uncapper_1.0.JPG\" alt=\"image\"><\/p>                <p class=\"detail-caption\"><strong>mockup 1<\/strong><\/p>                    <p class=\"detail-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/eb\/f9\/27\/3f\/76\/medication_uncapper_2.0.JPG\" alt=\"image\"><\/p>                <p class=\"detail-caption\"><strong>mockup 2<\/strong><\/p>                    <p class=\"detail-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/23\/fc\/44\/24\/3d\/medication_uncapper_3.0.JPG\" alt=\"image\"><\/p>                <p class=\"detail-caption\"><strong>for mockup 3 all I did was change that dimension from 1.5 to 1.475<\/strong><\/p>                    <p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>'final' model<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>This was designed using a series of extrusions in inventor, then filleting them for more grip. After getting feedback from Venture Cafe, where someone with a broken had tried to use it, I decided that the lever is a must. It allows people to place their bottle on the opener, then well open it with just one working hand. (will add more about this later)<\/p><\/div><h1 class=\"thing-component-header custom custom-section\">Custom Section<\/h1><p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Displayed the Product at Venture Cafe<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>So Yesterday (10\/23\/15) I showed the medication bottle opener off at the venture cafe to get some user feedback, and I'm shocked that I had no negative feedback! There were several sales reps who now want to give my product to their clients (for Free!) to make life easier on them. Decided I should probably get back to the injection mold guys about getting one of those so this would cost less than $1 per unit. Thanks for inspiring me to create this product, hope it helps a lot of people.<br><a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.vencafstl.org\/event\/product-demo-spark-techology-soultions\/?instance_id=16659\">http:\/\/www.vencafstl.org\/event\/product-demo-spark-techology-soultions\/?instance_id=16659<\/a>#.<\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Now with a no handle option<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>There is a no handle option for the uncapper mockup 2 now. <\/p><\/div>                <div><p>As a small note, after the competition I'll make the license more open, just would prefer no remakes before then.<\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Additional Resources<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>One thing if you do not have to worry about having non 'child proof' lids is to just ask your pharmacist for easy open pill bottles, most carriers have some form of arthritis friendly containers.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n",

Another small experimental feature I added was a second ring inside for tackling smaller pill bottle caps.<\/p><\/div>\n"

There were several sales reps who now want to give my product to their clients (for Free!) to make life easier on them. Decided I should probably get back to the injection mold guys about getting one of those so this would cost less than $1 per unit.
