Thermoplastic polyurethane or TPU comes out of the extruder slightly tacky. Once cooled it doesn't stretch, but will flex and bend when force is applied returning to its original position afterwards. My idea was to incorporate a flexible joint with stiff structure to make it bend in predictable ways.   \r\n\r\nThis my first design using TPU, so I decided to make something that I could test simply.
