With a small alligator clip or other attachments, it could provide help in holding and magnifying small things that are being soldered, glued or otherwise worked on. I made one of the holding arms in two parts so that designing new holders would use less plastic and be swapable.\r\n\r\nThe holding arms were designed to use this thing to hold the card, simply because it worked and I had one lying around: http:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:635200\r\n\r\nMy time and PLA went into designing this thing.
