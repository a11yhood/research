His school started using an iPad to supplement his speech and looking at some of the prices for mounts out there, I decided I would create one!  \n\nThis mount would likely need to change depending on your wheelchair if you choose to use it, since piping may be a bit different.  The hole for the pipe is oversized as I used some rubber placemat material to wrap around the tube to prevent it from being scratched and it gave it an excellent grip!  The iPad is velcroed to the top plate, and seems to hold well!  \n\nThe gooseneck that I used is this one:  \n\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Stage-Microphone-19-inch-Gooseneck-Black\/dp\/B00080KNG8\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440721630&sr=8-1&keywords=On+Stage+Microphone+19-inch+Gooseneck%2C+Black&pebp=1440721632588&perid=0HFHHQBQQNKR42E9AP77  \n\nThe small hardware are standard 4-40 nuts and bolts.  The larger bolt for the gooseneck will vary depending on the gooseneck used and if you purchase an adapter or not.  \n\nWith the iPad on it, it seems to sag a bit, but it is manageable.  It will work until I find a stronger neck.  Something to note.. there is a difference between the US and UK style microphone goose necks.  Oddly, the US versions use a different thread pattern that you can't go to a hardware store (at least around here) and find hardware that will work with it.  I had to get adapters to make it work for me.  Also, the hole for the large bolt is not large enough for a socket.. purposefully did that so one has to use pliers to tighten it and ensures not to overtighten it.  A user can then unscrew the gooseneck from the top if you should need to fold up the wheelchair.  \n\nIt is not an elegant solution by any means... but it is my first real project created in CAD, so being a total n00b I am impressed with it! :)  Note: I apologize for the orientation... I will fix that when I get the chance (and figure out what orientation the parts SHOULD be in  when saved!)",
