They still need a little work in the tensioning elastic of each joint but they're getting there.  \nThe palm and thumb are causing more headaches. I want it to have an extra degree of freedom that the anthromod 1 didn't have.  \n\nI also want the final design to have some lateral flex in the knuckles, to help it grip better.  \n\nThe design needs a lot of cleaning up before I release properly. As I'm focusing on the parametric aspect I won't be happy until the 'back end' of it works as well as it looks.  \n\nI also want to make it compatible with E-nable type prosthetics, so I need to design the with that in mind as well.",
