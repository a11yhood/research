Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a group of inherited heterogeneous disorders that share a common decrease in the tensile strength and integrity of the skin, joints, and other connective tissues.\r\n\r\nFor her, one of the ways this manifests itself is hyper-extension of her fingers that causes painful swelling.\r\n\r\nOne day she showed me some ring-splints that she could buy on line, but they where VERY expensive and I thought... Wait a minute... I can print that...\r\n\r\nSo, here are my Ehlers-danlos ring-splints that she wears now every day.  A complete set for her costs about 1$ worth of flexible filament and takes 15 min to print.\r\n\r\nI'm working on how to make this a customizer app so it's easier for others to make ones that fit them, but I have found that just scaling these up or down in your printing software works well.\r\n\r\nShe has been wearing them for a few weeks now, and they apparently work very well.  Going to be making her a new slightly smaller set as well as they are fitting a bit lose now due to her swelling going down.\r\n\r\nI hope these can help more people out there as well!  \r\n\r\nThe pictures here are of my friend wearing her splints after the final fitting (pictures used with her permission).",
