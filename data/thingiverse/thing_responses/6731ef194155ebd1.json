So I made the first card holder and sent it to him he enjoyed it greatly as the slots make it super easy to put cards it and orginise them, but the large size makes it hard to tip over. With all the rows there was plenty of space for when we played Uno those of you who have played will know how you can get 30+ cards, the only down side is if you looked over it was rather easy to see the cards, that problem has been addressed in this one as I put large sides on it to prevent wandering eyes. Unfortunately I cannot make another one of these at college (or at least not yet) so I have kept all dimensions the same as the old one so use it as a reference for size.  If you see any problems with it or have a suggestion let me know I will be making improvements. ",
