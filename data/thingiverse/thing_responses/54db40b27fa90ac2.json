It was a very simple model. From there, working with prosthetists from various clinics in the US, we learned the added value of a 2.5 inch extension of tubing near the wrist so that the forearm could be fit and cut down to a perfect length for each patient. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the elbow cuff location, slots were designed to match the metal saddle extensions from the elbow. Pins were added to fit in the pre-cut holes in the elbow so that the elbow sits inside the printed forearm and locks into place. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U-shaped cut was added to the design after the first print was done without it. This cut allows the user full flexion and extension of their prosthetic elbow without hitting the forearm.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing we decided to edit was the fill density of the print. Due to time constraints, the first print was 20% infill that we fit with a patient and it worked well. However, for heavy lifting or stronger forces, we believe that the time it takes to print the forearm in 100% infill is worth it. For prototyping an arm with the intention of lamination of a final product, a 20% or even 10% infill is sufficient.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upwards extensions on both sides of the forearm were added most recently, to allow for attachment of the cable housing running from the upper arm and the harness to the hook. In this design, there are two of these extension tabs so that the arm can be used on either a left or right arm. The unused tab can be cut off of the arm.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first design with the pin extension for the cable housing was too weak, so reinforcements were added along the walls of the forearm where it's exposed to the stress of the elbow saddle. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;<\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n",
