There are absolutely no pill container that can compare to this one, especially for the disabled.<\/p><\/div><h1 class=\"thing-component-header design how-i-designed-this\">How I Designed This<\/h1><div><p>I designed this at my school in my Engineering II and Tech Ninja classes as an assignment. Every student in the Engineering II class was given time to research and come up with a design to make. I also was allowed to work on the design in my Tech Ninja class. The Tech Ninja class is a new class that a teacher in my middle school ran that invited kids that were motivated to go beyond any other class with technology and learn much more about different technologies. The first year I have moved to high school they didn't have a Tech Ninja class but this year my Engineering II teacher took up the job to run the class. In my design I chose to start with Part 2 before I moved onto any of the other parts. I worked off of Part 2 went on to design Part 1, Part 3, and then Part 4. While working on the different parts I had to make many various changes to the design to improve the design and make it work better meaning that the parts fit together better and the have a less chance at breaking. While making the design I also wanted to make it small and compact so that it didn't take much space and so that it was cheaper to print. I was originally planning on having lids on top of the container but the idea was scrapped for a couple of reasons. One of the reasons is that it would be difficult for the disabled to remove it and put it back on to put pills into the container, defeating one of the major points of the pill case. Also, due to the container's shape I was having some issues making a good cover and if I were to make one it probably wouldn't have worked too well. The program I used in the whole process of designing and making the pill container was Solidworks. The cover photos of the pill container was made using the render tool in Solidworks as well as all of the other photos under the Assembly Instructions.<\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Version 1.0<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>Version 1.0 was my first design on the pill case and was really successful. When I got it 3D printed there were some flaws however. One of the main flaws was that when I was making it in Solidworks I was using exact measurements for when I had to connect parts. Therefore, many of the parts did not go together because they were too tight or just too big. Another flaw was that the bottom of Part 2 was very thin and looked as if you could easily break it. Finally, a minor flaw was that the plate that the pill falls onto wouldn't have done a good job with holding the pills. The pills would have likely just fell out of it.<\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/04\/02\/a6\/f8\/2b\/Version_1_Assembly.JPG\" alt=\"image\"><\/p>                <p class=\"detail-caption\"><strong>Picture of Version 1.0 Assistive Rotating Pill Container<\/strong><\/p>                    <p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Version 1.1<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>Version 1.1 has the same features of Version 1.1 but added a neat option on how to print it out. The option is printing Part 3 with clear plastic to make it see through. This allows you to see the pills easier and it makes it look better in my opinion. Please note that this is completely optional.<\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/39\/b1\/2d\/69\/c6\/Version_1_Assembly_-_Clear.JPG\" alt=\"image\"><\/p>                <p class=\"detail-caption\"><strong>Picture of Version 1.1 Assistive Rotating Pill Container<\/strong><\/p>                    <p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Version 2.0<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>In version 2 I fixed a lot of issues that I have found after printing version 1. All of the places that parts go together are now fixed so they will fit correctly now when printed out. While correcting that flaw I also made it easier to assemble Parts 1 &amp; 2. I also tried to do my best to make sure the pill case can easily spin with no problem. Another issue that was fixed is that I added more material to the bottom of Part 2 so it won't break. Finally, I increased the wall size of the plate so when pills land on it, they won't just fall out. I also added a few fillets where I saw fit while fixing the problems of version 1. Please note that version 2 does not change the look of the pill case much but changes up the mechanics tremendously. If you want access to the files of version 1 for some reason please add a comment or send me an email (email address located under the \"Contact Me\" section).<\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/ad\/11\/c4\/67\/12\/Version_2_Assembly_-_Clear.JPG\" alt=\"image\"><\/p>                <p class=\"detail-caption\"><strong>Picture of Version 2.0 Assistive Rotating Pill Container<\/strong><\/p>                    <p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Version 2.1<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>After making Version 2.0 I noticed that some fillets were missing that were in Version 1.0 and 1.1.

The first one is the the front wall in front of the plate on Part 1 was made taller. This was made taller in a previous version also. The first reason why it was made taller was so it was harder for pills to fall out of. The second reason was so that the text on the front of it would be more visible. Going off of the second reason, the second change that I made was to add \"AT\" on the front of it as well as a heart. The \"AT\" stands for Assistive Technology which is the purpose of making this design.<\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com\/assets\/b1\/ad\/bb\/df\/2d\/Version_2.3_Assembly_Picture_-_Clear.JPG\" alt=\"image\"><\/p>                <p class=\"detail-caption\"><strong>Picture of Version 2.3 Assistive Rotating Pill Container<\/strong><\/p><h1 class=\"thing-component-header custom assembly-instructions\">Assembly Instructions<\/h1><p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Pre-Assembly Notes<\/strong><\/p>                <div><p>The only tools or supplies that you need is some sort of glue or adhesive.

It's also an improvement to the pill containers that have snap-on covers that may be hard to remove for some people as well as being hard to get the pills out. The container is shaped as a heptagon for each day of the week and as you rotate the pill container, the pills in the slot for the next day will fall out onto a plate that can easily be grabbed. The container is simply rotated by spinning the top or sides of the design clockwise. This allows people with limited hand or wrist mobility to easily rotate it to get the pills that they may need for the day. The top of the container, which is the part that allows you to spin it, has openings to allow you to easily put pills in by dropping it in the day of the week that you need it. The pill container consists of four parts which are individually 3D printed and assembled. The only thing that you need is a few drops of glue or adhesive to hold a couple of the parts together in a very simple and explained 5 step process. It's also designed so that the parts already interlock with each other so you can even use plain Elmer glue to do the job. Not only can people with disabilities use this product. Any can print it out and use it as a pill container. Not only is it functional but it also looks really neat as well. The Assistive Pill Container is very compact, yet extremely functional. Since it's so compact it doesn't require much plastic filament (3.63 cubic inches) in order to print out making it very cheap as well. There are absolutely no pill container that can compare to this one, especially for the disabled.<\/p><\/div>\n"

            "content": "<div><p>I designed this at my school in my Engineering II and Tech Ninja classes as an assignment. Every student in the Engineering II class was given time to research and come up with a design to make. I also was allowed to work on the design in my Tech Ninja class. The Tech Ninja class is a new class that a teacher in my middle school ran that invited kids that were motivated to go beyond any other class with technology and learn much more about different technologies. The first year I have moved to high school they didn't have a Tech Ninja class but this year my Engineering II teacher took up the job to run the class. In my design I chose to start with Part 2 before I moved onto any of the other parts. I worked off of Part 2 went on to design Part 1, Part 3, and then Part 4. While working on the different parts I had to make many various changes to the design to improve the design and make it work better meaning that the parts fit together better and the have a less chance at breaking. While making the design I also wanted to make it small and compact so that it didn't take much space and so that it was cheaper to print. I was originally planning on having lids on top of the container but the idea was scrapped for a couple of reasons. One of the reasons is that it would be difficult for the disabled to remove it and put it back on to put pills into the container, defeating one of the major points of the pill case. Also, due to the container's shape I was having some issues making a good cover and if I were to make one it probably wouldn't have worked too well. The program I used in the whole process of designing and making the pill container was Solidworks. The cover photos of the pill container was made using the render tool in Solidworks as well as all of the other photos under the Assembly Instructions.<\/p><\/div>\n"

One of the main flaws was that when I was making it in Solidworks I was using exact measurements for when I had to connect parts. Therefore, many of the parts did not go together because they were too tight or just too big. Another flaw was that the bottom of Part 2 was very thin and looked as if you could easily break it. Finally, a minor flaw was that the plate that the pill falls onto wouldn't have done a good job with holding the pills. The pills would have likely just fell out of it.<\/p><\/div>\n"

I also tried to do my best to make sure the pill case can easily spin with no problem. Another issue that was fixed is that I added more material to the bottom of Part 2 so it won't break. Finally, I increased the wall size of the plate so when pills land on it, they won't just fall out. I also added a few fillets where I saw fit while fixing the problems of version 1. Please note that version 2 does not change the look of the pill case much but changes up the mechanics tremendously.
