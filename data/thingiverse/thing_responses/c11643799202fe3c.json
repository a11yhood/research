This was to help anyone with dexterity issues that made holding normal silverware difficult. This design is also useful to anyone who breaks their fingers and is wearing a cast.&lt;br&gt;This design fits between the pointer and small finger to support silverware. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked with Ty Lendit to finalize the design in AutoCAD. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is sized to fit my hand, and you can easily scale it up or down to fit the width of your own hand. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure the outside distance between your middle and ring finger to give you the size to scale to.
