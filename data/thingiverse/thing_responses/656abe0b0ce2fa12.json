The flexible hinges have been designed in a \"U\" shaped configuration to prevent them from flopping around the center point and give improved spring-back. The center is also cut out to prevent the hinge from sliding out during operation. They are fitted from one side, and then stretched to fit from the other side. The hinges have a dampener which forms a part of the knuckle. There are two reasons for this.. The first reason is to allow for silent operation with no contact of plastic parts. The second reason is to fill the gap when opened to allow gloves to be worn without getting caught in the void.<br>2) Joints: Having the center available in the joint allows the tendon hole to come as far forward and as close to the hinge as possible, requiring less retraction of the tendon to close the finger. Bringing the tendon guide hole as far forward as possible also allows the cavity for the finger to come very close to the joint allowing for realistic finger length when the finger is severed close to the joint.<br>3) Tendon guide: The flexible tendon guide is comfortable and flexes with the hand. It does not bear the load of the tendon, rather it is only a guide to the rigid tensioner clip. The rigid tensioner clip takes the full load of the tendon, and is fixed to the wrist by a Velcro strap. Therefore, there is no stretching of the flexible tendon guide which improves grip strength.<br>4) Grips: The grips are also printed in flexible material and provide more grip than plastic. I have also made a scalable mold for super grippy silicone tips which will be uploaded shortly. The grips have key-ways to assist in adhesion when glued into place. <\/p><\/div>                <p class=\"detail-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.thingiverse.com\/assets\/d6\/04\/bc\/4a\/96\/Assembly_exploded3.JPG\" alt=\"image\"><\/p><\/div>\n",

            "content": "<div><p>I would like to share with you the key merits of the design in the hope that some of you may find it useful for improving your own designs.<br>1) Hinges. The flexible hinges have been designed in a \"U\" shaped configuration to prevent them from flopping around the center point and give improved spring-back. The center is also cut out to prevent the hinge from sliding out during operation. They are fitted from one side, and then stretched to fit from the other side. The hinges have a dampener which forms a part of the knuckle. There are two reasons for this.. The first reason is to allow for silent operation with no contact of plastic parts. The second reason is to fill the gap when opened to allow gloves to be worn without getting caught in the void.<br>2) Joints: Having the center available in the joint allows the tendon hole to come as far forward and as close to the hinge as possible, requiring less retraction of the tendon to close the finger. Bringing the tendon guide hole as far forward as possible also allows the cavity for the finger to come very close to the joint allowing for realistic finger length when the finger is severed close to the joint.<br>3) Tendon guide: The flexible tendon guide is comfortable and flexes with the hand. It does not bear the load of the tendon, rather it is only a guide to the rigid tensioner clip. The rigid tensioner clip takes the full load of the tendon, and is fixed to the wrist by a Velcro strap. Therefore, there is no stretching of the flexible tendon guide which improves grip strength.<br>4) Grips: The grips are also printed in flexible material and provide more grip than plastic. I have also made a scalable mold for super grippy silicone tips which will be uploaded shortly. The grips have key-ways to assist in adhesion when glued into place. <\/p><\/div>\n"
