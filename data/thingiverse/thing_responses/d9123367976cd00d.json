These resources will help prepare you for designing and 3D printing your own attachments. The resources will also help you understand how 3D printing works.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Once you have completed Step 1, go to the Project Prostheducate Thingiverse Page and download all of the files. Print each file as many times as follows:<br>Attachment Base- 1<br>Wrist- 1<br>Long Hinge Pins- 2<br>Computer Keyboard Typing Attachment- 1<br>iPhone Holder- 1<br>Pencil Holder- 1<br>Shoe Tying Helper- 1<br>Snack Cup Holder- 1<br>Spoon and Fork Holder- 1<br>Toothbrush Holder- 1<br>Violin Bow Holder- 1<\/p><\/li><li><p>Assemble the Project Prostheducate Prosthetic using the instructions below.<br>A. Once you have printed every part of the prosthetic, you can start assembling. Lay everything out on a flat surface so it is easy to find the parts.assembling. Lay everything out on a flat surface so it is easy to find the parts.<\/p><pre><code>            B. The first thing you will assemble is the wrist. The wrist part of the prosthetic comes in two sections so it can fit on smaller printers. Glue the two pieces together using super glue or hot glue. The pieces should fit perfectly together. Then, use pliers or other tools to remove the six support structures. There are gaps in the wrist for Velcro straps. Using Velcro is optional. The Velcro should go through the top gap and out through the other top. Then down through the one bottom one and out the other end. The Velcro straps are used to secure the amputee's wrist to the prosthetic.            C. Now that the wrist is assembled, you can start assembling the prosthetic. Grab the wrist, attachment base, and the two hinge pins included in the wrist file. Then, line up the holes on the wrist and attachment base. Insert the two hinge pins into the holes. This secures the wrist and attachment base together.            D. The prosthetic is now complete, but the attachments still need to be assembled. See Step 5 for individual instructions on each attachment. To insert an attachment into the Project Prostheducate Prosthetic, you will need the two long hinge pins, the prosthetic, and an attachment. Insert the attachment into the prosthetic at the front. The holes will automatically line up as long as the attachment is fully inserted. Push the two long hinge pins all the way into the wrist through the holes. This secures the attachment to the prosthetic. This process works for every attachment. You can now use the prosthetic and its attachment.            E. Individual Instructions on Each Attachment:<\/code><\/pre><p>Computer Keyboard Typing Attachment- This attachment does not need to be assembled.<br>iPhone Holder- To assemble the iphone holder, you need all of the parts included in the iPhone Holder file found on the Project Prostheducate Thingiverse Page. (See the pictures below for the names of the parts.) Line up the holes on the arm and the stand, then insert the hinge pins into the holes. This secures the arm and the stand together. The iPhone Holder is designed to fit both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. Look at the pictures below for instructions on how to change the attachment to fit the different iPhones.<br>Pencil Holder- This attachment does not need to be assembled, but it requires a rubber band. In order for the pencil not to slide through the attachment, you need to wrap a rubber band around it. The height at which you wrap it is up to you. Push the pencil through the attachment until it doesn\u2019t fall out when turned upside down. The attachment can also hold pens, some highlighters, and some markers.<br>Shoe Tying Helper- This attachment does not need to be assembled.<br>Spoon and Fork Holder- This attachment does not need to be assembled, but it requires a rubber band. In order for the spoon or fork to stay in the attachment and not fall out, it needs to be secured with a rubber band. The rubber band should be wrapped around the pegs sticking out of the attachment.<br>Snack Cup Holder- To assemble the Snack Cup Holder, you will need super glue\/hot glue. Glue the bottom of the holder part of the attachment to the insert part of the attachment.<br>Toothbrush Holder- To assemble the Toothbrush Holder, you will need super glue or hot glue. Make sure you have all of the parts from the Toothbrush Holder file. Take the slider part and stick it through the base part. Glue the plate part onto the bottom of the slider part. This secures the Slider to the Base, while still allowing it to move around. To secure the toothbrush in the holder, use a rubber band. Wrap the rubber band around the pegs and around the Plate Part on the bottom of the holder. (See pictures for help with rubber band.)<br>Violin Bow Holder- To assemble the Violin Bow Holder, glue the Bow Holder part to the insert part. Make sure the skinnier pegs are on the sides and the thicker pegs are on the top and bottom. (See pictures for help with this.) You can add a rubber band to secure the violin bow in the holder.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Once you have printed and assembled the Project Prostheducate Prosthetic, your next task is to play around with it! Study how it works and try to understand how it was designed.<\/p><\/li><li><p>If you understand how the prosthetic works and how it was designed, you are ready to start designing your own prosthetic attachment. Design your attachment on 123d Design. Import the Attachment Insert file into a new design plane in 123d Design. Then, create your attachment coming off of that model. Be patient, you will go through many prototypes before finalizing your prosthetic attachment.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Once you have designed an attachment, you can download that file and 3D print it. If your attachment doesn\u2019t work like it should, just keep trying. You will succeed eventually.<\/p><\/li><li>When your attachment is perfect and doesn\u2019t need any editing, you are then ready to upload your attachment.

Once you have printed every part of the prosthetic, you can start assembling. Lay everything out on a flat surface so it is easy to find the parts.assembling. Lay everything out on a flat surface so it is easy to find the parts.<\/p><pre><code>            B. The first thing you will assemble is the wrist. The wrist part of the prosthetic comes in two sections so it can fit on smaller printers. Glue the two pieces together using super glue or hot glue. The pieces should fit perfectly together. Then, use pliers or other tools to remove the six support structures. There are gaps in the wrist for Velcro straps. Using Velcro is optional. The Velcro should go through the top gap and out through the other top. Then down through the one bottom one and out the other end. The Velcro straps are used to secure the amputee's wrist to the prosthetic.            C. Now that the wrist is assembled, you can start assembling the prosthetic. Grab the wrist, attachment base, and the two hinge pins included in the wrist file. Then, line up the holes on the wrist and attachment base. Insert the two hinge pins into the holes. This secures the wrist and attachment base together.            D. The prosthetic is now complete, but the attachments still need to be assembled. See Step 5 for individual instructions on each attachment. To insert an attachment into the Project Prostheducate Prosthetic, you will need the two long hinge pins, the prosthetic, and an attachment. Insert the attachment into the prosthetic at the front. The holes will automatically line up as long as the attachment is fully inserted. Push the two long hinge pins all the way into the wrist through the holes. This secures the attachment to the prosthetic. This process works for every attachment. You can now use the prosthetic and its attachment.            E. Individual Instructions on Each Attachment:<\/code><\/pre><p>Computer Keyboard Typing Attachment- This attachment does not need to be assembled.<br>iPhone Holder- To assemble the iphone holder, you need all of the parts included in the iPhone Holder file found on the Project Prostheducate Thingiverse Page. (See the pictures below for the names of the parts.) Line up the holes on the arm and the stand, then insert the hinge pins into the holes. This secures the arm and the stand together. The iPhone Holder is designed to fit both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. Look at the pictures below for instructions on how to change the attachment to fit the different iPhones.<br>Pencil Holder- This attachment does not need to be assembled, but it requires a rubber band. In order for the pencil not to slide through the attachment, you need to wrap a rubber band around it. The height at which you wrap it is up to you. Push the pencil through the attachment until it doesn\u2019t fall out when turned upside down. The attachment can also hold pens, some highlighters, and some markers.<br>Shoe Tying Helper- This attachment does not need to be assembled.<br>Spoon and Fork Holder- This attachment does not need to be assembled, but it requires a rubber band. In order for the spoon or fork to stay in the attachment and not fall out, it needs to be secured with a rubber band. The rubber band should be wrapped around the pegs sticking out of the attachment.<br>Snack Cup Holder- To assemble the Snack Cup Holder, you will need super glue\/hot glue. Glue the bottom of the holder part of the attachment to the insert part of the attachment.<br>Toothbrush Holder- To assemble the Toothbrush Holder, you will need super glue or hot glue. Make sure you have all of the parts from the Toothbrush Holder file. Take the slider part and stick it through the base part. Glue the plate part onto the bottom of the slider part. This secures the Slider to the Base, while still allowing it to move around. To secure the toothbrush in the holder, use a rubber band. Wrap the rubber band around the pegs and around the Plate Part on the bottom of the holder. (See pictures for help with rubber band.)<br>Violin Bow Holder- To assemble the Violin Bow Holder, glue the Bow Holder part to the insert part. Make sure the skinnier pegs are on the sides and the thicker pegs are on the top and bottom. (See pictures for help with this.) You can add a rubber band to secure the violin bow in the holder.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Once you have printed and assembled the Project Prostheducate Prosthetic, your next task is to play around with it! Study how it works and try to understand how it was designed.<\/p><\/li><li><p>If you understand how the prosthetic works and how it was designed, you are ready to start designing your own prosthetic attachment. Design your attachment on 123d Design. Import the Attachment Insert file into a new design plane in 123d Design. Then, create your attachment coming off of that model. Be patient, you will go through many prototypes before finalizing your prosthetic attachment.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Once you have designed an attachment, you can download that file and 3D print it. If your attachment doesn\u2019t work like it should, just keep trying. You will succeed eventually.<\/p><\/li><li>When your attachment is perfect and doesn\u2019t need any editing, you are then ready to upload your attachment. You will need a Thingiverse account for this, so make an account if you don\u2019t have one. Log in to your Thingiverse account and upload your attachment to the \u201cMade\u201d section of the Project Prostheducate Thingiverse page. We would love to see the wonderful and useful attachments you create!<\/li><\/ol><\/div>"
