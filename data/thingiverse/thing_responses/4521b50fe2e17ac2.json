Stereo jacks can operate in unintended ways.<br>o    If you are supplying your own wire, use 20 or 22 gauge stranded wire.<br>\u2022   Wire Strippers<br>o    Necessary for working with the wires &amp; headphone jacks.<br>\u2022   A soldering iron and solder<br>o    Most soldering tips will work; see soldering instructions in Assembly Instructions for more details on how to solder the limit switches to the circuit board inserts.<br>\u2022   Limit Switches (3 per button)<br>o    I utilized Omron SS-3GP limit switches for my buttons; the circuit board inserts are designed to fit their \"legs.\"<br>o    Ensure that the limit switches you use are for through-holes and feature prongs where the longest edge of them is parallel to the longest edge of the switch body.<br>o    Depending on the profile of the limit switch you utilize, you may require the use of tape as \u201cshim\u201d on the pressing cylinders.<br>\u2022   Electrical or Masking Tape<br>o    Used as spacing between the upper half of the shell and the buttons on the limit switches.<br>\u2022   Hot Glue<br>o    Used to seal the hole in the bottom half print where the wire exits.<br>\u2022   A CNC mill or router<br>o    Used to create the circuit board inserts.
