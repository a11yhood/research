To help with this, we have designed an open-source, 3D printed, refreshable Braille display which can be made for less than $200.  \nBased on the premise of sliding bars with bumps to raise the dots, the bars are moved by small pager motors with worm gears (such as http:\/\/www.robotshop.com\/solarbotics-tiny-pager-motor-tpm2.html).  An Arduino will control the motors and receive feedback from a small resistive element in the center which will serve as a position sensor.  \nThe current design as posted is fully printable, but only functional manually.  \nModifications which still need to be made:  \n-resistance sensor and contact pocket need to be added.  Ideas include printed circuit boards, graphite rods (pencil lead) and ideally a conductive ABS filament (such as http:\/\/rainbot3d.com\/product_info.php?products_id=71) printed part which would be printed using a dual extrusion printer in-situ.  \n-Gear system needs to be upgraded.  Currently the worm gear direct drive to the bar requires too much torque for the small pager motor.  Adding a large spur gear with an axially attached smaller spur gear to reduce the required torque may be necessary.  Alternatively, a motor with more torque such as (http:\/\/www.robotshop.com\/solarbotics-gm15-gear-motor.html) may work.  \nOur Teams Mission Statement is:  \nTo leverage advances in materials research and manufacturing to reduce the cost and complexity of Refreshable Braille Displays to promote greater literacy in the blind and visually impaired community.  \nDesign is fully parametric in OpenSCAD (although there are some issues with using the scale feature at the moment, to be fixed in the future).  \nOriginal idea for control mechanism from:   \nhttp:\/\/www.kscitech.com\/BBT\/Slider_diagram1.jpg  \n8\/31\/13 Update:  \nAdded a sketch of a modified design incorporating a dual spur gear to improve the gearing of the mechanism.  I have been in the process of moving to graduate school so have not had a chance to update the openSCAD design with this yet, but will soon, as well as improving compatibility with customizer.  \n6\/29\/14 Update:  \nFound some interesting new motors on AliExpress and Ebay.

To help with this, we have designed an open-source, 3D printed, refreshable Braille display which can be made for less than $200.<br>Based on the premise of sliding bars with bumps to raise the dots, the bars are moved by small pager motors with worm gears (such as <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.robotshop.com\/solarbotics-tiny-pager-motor-tpm2.html\">http:\/\/www.robotshop.com\/solarbotics-tiny-pager-motor-tpm2.html<\/a>).  An Arduino will control the motors and receive feedback from a small resistive element in the center which will serve as a position sensor.<br>The current design as posted is fully printable, but only functional manually.<br>Modifications which still need to be made:<br>-resistance sensor and contact pocket need to be added.  Ideas include printed circuit boards, graphite rods (pencil lead) and ideally a conductive ABS filament (such as <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/rainbot3d.com\/product_info.php?products_id=71\">http:\/\/rainbot3d.com\/product_info.php?products_id=71<\/a>) printed part which would be printed using a dual extrusion printer in-situ.<br>-Gear system needs to be upgraded.  Currently the worm gear direct drive to the bar requires too much torque for the small pager motor.  Adding a large spur gear with an axially attached smaller spur gear to reduce the required torque may be necessary.  Alternatively, a motor with more torque such as (<a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.robotshop.com\/solarbotics-gm15-gear-motor.html\">http:\/\/www.robotshop.com\/solarbotics-gm15-gear-motor.html<\/a>) may work.<br>Our Teams Mission Statement is:<br>To leverage advances in materials research and manufacturing to reduce the cost and complexity of Refreshable Braille Displays to promote greater literacy in the blind and visually impaired community.<br>Design is fully parametric in OpenSCAD (although there are some issues with using the scale feature at the moment, to be fixed in the future).<br>Original idea for control mechanism from:<br><a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kscitech.com\/BBT\/Slider_diagram1.jpg\">http:\/\/www.kscitech.com\/BBT\/Slider_diagram1.jpg<\/a><br>8\/31\/13 Update:<br>Added a sketch of a modified design incorporating a dual spur gear to improve the gearing of the mechanism.
