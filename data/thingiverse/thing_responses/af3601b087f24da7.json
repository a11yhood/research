The only problem with them is that they need electricity and are made out of things other than 3D printed material. I thought that I could design a spoon that uses the same concept, but is able to be fully 3D printed. It took me a little while to first come up with a solid design that I felt could work, but after 3D printing a few pieces I realized that I had to make some changes with spacing and supports, as the first print had no supports or spacing so the handle and switch were one big piece instead of two pieces with supports separating them. After that, everything else was pretty fine except I changed the thickness of all of the pieces from one quarter of an inch to three quarters.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;<\/code><\/pre><h1 class=\"thing-component-header custom custom-section\">Custom Section<\/h1><p class=\"detail-title\"><strong>Files<\/strong><\/p><pre><code>            &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gyrospoon  files come with the handle and switch together in an assembly. The switch has enough space inside the handle so that there are supports there and not solid plastic. The files also come with the outer ring of the whole thing, and the spoon piece itself. These pieces are all needed in order for the gyrospoon to function. There are some optional pieces that you can use to improve the function of the Gyrospoon even though it already functions very well. These pieces are the locks. They go on the outside of the outer ring and spoon posts (the little pins that go into the whole of the piece to the outside) The switch may also be optional. Even though it is a part of one of the necessary pieces, you only need it when you are trying to eat something that is semi-solid.
