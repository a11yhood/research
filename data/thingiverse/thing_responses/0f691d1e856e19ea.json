The wrist can also rotate into multiple grasp positions. \r\n\r\nThe included 247 page Kinetic Arm Assembly Manual has been developed by our engineering team to be as visual as possible.

We even pay the postage. <\/p><p>We share all of our designs under open-source licenses, enabling people worldwide to create and repair their own devices. This approach not only democratises access to assistive technology but also encourages further innovation in this field. <\/p><p>The Kinetic Arm is our gift to the world, driven by the hope of creating equal access to assistive technology for all. It is through global collaboration that we can create an exponential impact. <\/p><p>Sharing of the Kinetic Arm design under an open-source license is a milestone made possible by the unwavering support of our incredible community. <\/p><p>Free 3D Hands is a charitable research and design organisation that relies entirely on donations to continue our mission. We are deeply grateful to our corporate sponsors, philanthropic supporters, community groups, and ongoing, one-time and anonymous donors. Your generosity and belief in our vision has enabled our dedicated team to devote over 4,000 hours over the past 2.5 years to developing the Kinetic Arm, as well as the assembly manual and instructional video over the last 4 months.<\/p><p>Thank you for believing in our vision and for helping us bring the Kinetic Arm to life.<\/p><p>The Kinetic Arm is a body-powered device, and is designed to be used by people with trans-radial arm differences, with a functioning elbow to open and close the fingers of the device. The wrist can also rotate into multiple grasp positions. <\/p><p>The included 247 page Kinetic Arm Assembly Manual has been developed by our engineering team to be as visual as possible. Each section of the manual links to a Kinetic Arm Assembly Tutorial Video on YouTube to share all of our assembly techniques. <\/p><p>The Kinetic Arm Assembly Tutorial Video can be viewed at: <a rel=\"ugc nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OC6OgWWjTK8\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OC6OgWWjTK8<\/a><\/p><p>If you have any questions regarding the Kinetic Arm or the Kinetic Arm Assembly Manual, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at Free 3D Hands. We would also love to add your Kinetic Arm makes to our Collaborators Wall in the Free 3D Hands Design Centre. Please email us your questions\/photos to info@free3dhands.org.
