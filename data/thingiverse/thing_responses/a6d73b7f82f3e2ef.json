I have news... sorta, in an engineering course I worked with a group of several students to improve this design and make it manufacturable. the improved design is more stable from a physics standpoint but doesn't use any 3D printed parts. I am working to adapt the design to a printable form factor and publish it online for all to use.\r\n\r\nSo these were created for a science fair project I did with the objective to try to develop several different types of drinking cups for people with parkinsons or suffer from a severe intention tremor.  \r\n\r\nMy grandfather, who has a severe intention tremor, burned himself trying to drink coffee one day and thats what inspired me to create these cups.  \r\n\r\nI only had my printer for a month before the fair, so I did not get to develop these as much as I had hoped to. In a later version there may be orientation locks, turning limits (so you can actually drink from it), and more standardized weights.  \r\n\r\nHeres the catch, If I hear that any one of you makermen and women think that this is a great idea, and say so in the comments, then I will complete my designs for these cups more proactively.   \r\n\r\nIn the axis series I have developed two designs which, like the double gimbaled root beer holder by EricYoung (see remixed), use a twisting handle on a frame that pivots on an axis that goes thru the cup. both designs are incomplete.  \r\n>the first cup is a simple frame design with the central axis located above the center of the cup. 3 bearings are used  \r\n>the second cup is a bearing track design. This used 7 bearings.   \r\n\r\n-The handle design is based on the \"Hand steady\" cup (http:\/\/www.handsteady.com\/) which allows a person to hold the apperatus in several differnt ways to reduce pottenial strain and twisting. When I finish the design there will be a turning limit with will allow the cup to rotate with the handle past a certain degree.
