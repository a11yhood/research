The major difference is the switch used in the enclosure.This version uses a <strong>mini-microswitch<\/strong> capable of switching <strong>five amps<\/strong> as opposed to the fifty millliamp limit of V4. Even so, I wouldn't go more than an amp or two since 1\/8\" (3.5mm) audio phone connectors are not designed to handle power. The physical size of this switch necessitates a  larger enclosure but is well suited to higher current applications such as motorized toys that have been switch adapted. As always, be aware of the load current of your application and make sure it does not exceed the rating of your AT switch. <\/p><p>This three part enclosure (no screws) makes the momentary microswitch more durable and accessible by providing protection and a larger activation surface. Designed with <strong>OpenSCAD<\/strong>, this parametric design allows selecting the build diameter, base style (plain or strap mounting) and button style (recessed or protruding) using <strong>Customizer<\/strong>. Make sure the custom diameter setting matches each of the three parts saved to insure they fit together. This version features a threaded latch and uses <strong>radial flexures<\/strong> for frictionless activation. Although it is frictionless, there is resistance from the flexures which increases the activation force slightly. Here's how the flexure works: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2EqkSfG4u5U\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/2EqkSfG4u5U<\/a><\/p><p>The <strong>DIYAT Switch<\/strong> is designed to be simple to build, durable, inexpensive (minimal parts) and customizable in size and style. This design is an assembly of three parts that fit together and must be printed with enough precision to operate correctly.<\/p><\/div>"
