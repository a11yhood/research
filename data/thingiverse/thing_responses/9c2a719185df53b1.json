The first thing I noticed was a mind-numbing variety of available pressure switches with huge amounts of overlap in functionality and features.  They\u2019re also hugely expensive.  It was difficult to understand why a particular manufacturer chose to incorporate a particular feature set into their switch, but once incorporated, there was little or no support for customization.\r\n\r\nWhile researching and writing my master's project, I happened to purchase a 3D Printer and immediately saw the opportunity that 3D printing created for low cost, one-off (personalized), manufacturing.
