October is also the month of my grandmothers birthday and about 10 years ago she was diagnosed with Alzheimer.  A debilitating disease that would eventually lead too her death.  In the approximate 8 years she lived prior to her death she slowly withered away.  It is my experiences in the nursing homes and hospitals where I would spend most of my time watching family caring for my grandmother that I began imagining ideas to help her.  When looking back at those experiences I found inspiration to create Grip_Zz.  I designed this based on a motorcycle grip combined with integrated pressure plates to contain objects. \r\n\r\nThe Objective of Grip_Zz is to integrate the ability to comfortably hold a toothbrush, spoon, or fork without slippage.  The grip_Zz extends the average handle of the object placed in the receptacle allowing for easier handling.  This means that patients who have difficult times brushing their teeth due to most debilitating diseases can now hold a toothbrush or other utensils with much more ease.  In my own experience, where my grandmother couldn't remember to hold a toothbrush, a Grip_Zz would have much improved the cleaning process of her mouth.  This is due to the nurses being able to gently use the Grip_Zz in the hands of the patient as they guide the tool around.  I Dearly wish my grandmother was still around, but I know if she was, the care gone into making a tool to extend her handle on daily objects would have greatly improved her attitude at some of the stages in her disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n>Interior pressure tabs\r\n>Spoon\/ Fork slot\r\n> safety ring\r\n\r\nAt the moment, this model is a rough version, ((Mach 1.) but I plan on updating it a bit every day with possible videos and new versions.  Here is what I plan to accomplish with the Grip_Zz before the contest deadline.\r\n>Round edges\r\n>Comfort options\r\n>test print\r\n>test video\r\n>test use\r\n>included printed lanyard\r\n>Size options\r\n>rear brim\r\n>Spoon fork addition\r\n>switchblade effect\r\n>Upgrade Teeth\r\n\r\nPlease leave a comment, if you feel comfortable, related to your loved ones and any issues you feel important to share with the world.

That is, they take a standard 1\/4\" bolt with 20 threads per inch.  These mounts are everywhere (there are over 3000 camera mounts with 4+ stars on Amazon) including on Tripods, Brackets, Monopods, Booms, etc.  Being able to use these tools to position AT Switches is a huge advantage and these \"things\" will help make that happen.\r\n\r\nThe first that I'm posting is a 3\" mount that uses a 1\/4-20 \"T-Nut\" to create the socket.  T-Nuts are used in rock climbing walls and are available at your local hardware store for about $.60 or online for about $.10  This design calls for a T-Nut with a total height of .6in (I believe they are sold as 1\/2\" but don't count the base).\r\n\r\nTo assemble this, you will also need a 1\/4-20 bolt that's at least 3\/4\" long to pull the t-nut into place.

The major difference is the switch used in the enclosure.This version uses a **mini-microswitch** capable of switching **five amps** as opposed to the fifty millliamp limit of V4. Even so, I wouldn't go more than an amp or two since 1\/8\" (3.5mm) audio phone connectors are not designed to handle power. The physical size of this switch necessitates a  larger enclosure but is well suited to higher current applications such as motorized toys that have been switch adapted. As always, be aware of the load current of your application and make sure it does not exceed the rating of your AT switch. \r\n\r\nThis three part enclosure (no screws) makes the momentary microswitch more durable and accessible by providing protection and a larger activation surface.

Make sure the custom diameter setting matches each of the three parts saved to insure they fit together.

Over that period, we have made continuous incremental improvements to the design based on recipient feedback. The Kinetic Hand is a body powered device, and is designed to be used by people with congenital hand differences, with a functioning wrist to open and close the fingers. \r\n\r\nThe Kinetic Hand design is being released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) open-source license to encourage further innovation in this field, and improve global access to assistive technology. \r\nThis design is released for trial and evaluation purposes only, and is intended to benefit certain individuals with specific hand differences and is not intended, and shall not be used, for commercial purposes.\r\nThe acceptance of this design by Free 3D Hands Ltd, and any such information provided by the design team is presented as is without representation or warranties of any kind, express or implied, and is intended to be a free gift to recipients for the sole purpose of evaluating various design iterations, ideas and modifications. The Kinetic Hand must be used for only light tasks such as picking and placing of small objects, and not for any tasks that could be considered dangerous.  Any individual associated with Free 3D Hands Ltd shall not be liable for any injuries or damages resulting from the use of any information or designs provided. The Kinetic Hand is experimental, is not classified as a medical device, and is for evaluation purposes only. In some cases, these devices will not be appropriate for each individual, and consultation with medical professionals and occupational therapists must be sought and obtained before use.\r\n\r\nDesign Merits:\r\n\r\nSilent Operation\r\nThe flexible hinges are designed to prevent any contact between rigid parts, allowing for silent operation of the hand.\r\n\r\nMoulded Silicone Finger Grips\r\nUsing a scalable 3D printed mould, grippy silicone finger grips allow the fingers to better grip a wide range of objects. This also eliminates the need to use consumer products such as Lee Tippi Micro-Gel finger grips which are hard to source, expensive and limited to only a few sizes. \r\n\r\nSplit Hinges\r\nThe hinges are designed to fit from one side, and stretch fit from the other. This prevents the hinge from sliding out laterally. Hinges do not require any glue, and provide an ideal amount of elasticity to open the fingers.\r\n\r\nDual Tendons \r\nThe need to tie tendons in the fingers has been eliminated, with tendons looping back through the fingers and hand being tied only once at the tensioner.\r\n\r\nFlexible Tensioners\r\nThe tensioners are made from an elastic material to allow individual fingers to come to a close while the other fingers continue to travel. There is no inter-connection between fingers, allowing for even grip distribution on a wide range of different object shapes.\r\n\r\nPart Numbering\r\nAll of the finger parts, hinges and grips are individually numbered to assist during assembly, ensuring correct part position and orientation.\r\n\r\nAllowance for Partial Thumb\r\nBy optimising wall thicknesses and tendon routing, we have created additional space inside the Palm cavity to allow for a partial thumb.\r\n\r\nFlexible Palm Cover\r\nThe flexible Palm Cover improves comfort for the user, since this is where all of the force is applied during use. It can also stretch to help when inserting the partial hand. \r\n\r\nAdjustable Tensioner Positions\r\nTensioner positions can be adjusted under the Gauntlet Cover to allow individual finger open and close positions to be incrementally adjusted to suit individual preference.\r\n \r\nProtective Gauntlet Cover\r\nTensioners and tendon knots are protected by the Gauntlet Cover to improve durability and prevent damage. \r\n\r\nImproved Scalability\r\nThe Kinetic Hand has been tested successfully between scales of 50% and 100% of the CAD model, which is designed at the scale of a large adult. We recommend 60% as the minimum scale to use for part strength and ease of assembly. \r\n\r\nPrinting Support Elimination\r\nAll parts have been designed and oriented to eliminate the need for printing supports which are difficult and time consuming to remove. \r\n\r\nSmooth Part Surfaces\r\nThe parts have been oriented to minimise the appearance of 3D print layers, whilst maintaining strength in design. \r\n\r\nIncreased Durability\r\nThe flexible hinges allow fingers to be bent and twisted to the same degree as a human finger without breaking.\r\n\r\nThree Directional Scalability\r\nSince the Kinetic Hand uses flexible hinges rather than snap pins, it can be scaled in X, Y and Z directions independantly without compromising part fitment or function. \r\n\r\nEased Fitting Tolerances\r\nRegardless of hand scale and size, the flexible hinges are designed to fit tightly with no need for fitting tolerances at different scales.  \r\n\r\nReduced Closing Angle\r\nThe Kinetic Hand only requires 18 degrees of wrist movement to allow the fingers to fully close, making it able to be used by people with very limited wrist movement.\r\n\r\nMultiple Palm Variants\r\nTo accommodate for various levels of hand difference, we have designed multiple palm variants to suit these conditions.

Dual DC Motor drivers - with or without Joystick control \/ with or without Arduino.\r\n\r\n2.  An Arduino and a couple of solid state relay boards (dual H Bridge) to drive the motors at 18V. \r\n\r\nSept 2016 - I got some new controllers to try out.  Thus far, the \"Cytron 10A 5-25V Dual Channel DC Motor Drivers\",  purchased from: http:\/\/www.robotshop.com\/eu\/en\/10a-5-30v-dual-channel-dc-motor-driver.html  \r\nlook very promising indeed.  (Control option 1)\r\n\r\nThese controllers come with inbuilt \"test\" buttons - forward and backwards for each of the 2 motor channels.  \r\nThe test buttons can be wired directly to the switches on the legs, meaning there's no requirement for Arduino and coding, if simple control fits your needs.  \r\nHowever, they can still be interfaced to Arduino for more advanced control options if That's your requirement. \r\nThe Cytron boards also support joystick control - right out of the box!\r\n\r\nTwo control units will be required (one for each leg) but there is a pleasing simplicity to the (option 1) control layout. \r\nAn added benefit is that some protections are built in to the controller board  (against short circuits and so on) - so they're pretty robust.  So far - I'm very happy with them.\r\n\r\nDual H Bridges (Control option 2)\r\nhttp:\/\/mg.elecrow.com\/arduino-compatible\/shield.html\r\nhttp:\/\/www.homotix.eu\/product.php~idx~~~586~~locale~~~225~~Dual+Channel+H_Bridge+Motor+Shield+_8A+22V~.html\r\n\r\nChoose your own batteries - I'm using 18v Ni-Cd 'battery drill' batteries (Makita) for the testing - there's probably better choices for endurance, performance, size etc. out there.  For function testing - the drill batteries serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe 20X20 aluminium extrusion provides multiple attachment points for linkages, batteries cover panels\/enclosures etc. It is strong \/ lightweight and readily available.\r\n\r\n\r\nThigh Support files uploaded. - You may need to print them at 95% scale as the thigh support is right on printer limits for size (200X200X200).  If you have a square print bed - place them on the bed at 45 degree angle to maximise the print size.\r\n\r\nNote - All Leg supports are best printed at 100% Infill.\r\n\r\nI added a general purpose strap attachment point for the harness - for additional supports, back brace etc.  Can be attached where needed in your particular situation.  For back support -- Straps could be used from the hip motor mount, crossing at the chest and attaching to this clip at the mid point (top) of the back of the harness.\r\n\r\nThe Arduino code is pretty raw, it's just to get the motors moving.  (For control option 2) but it does need more work.\r\nYou'll need the excellent driver that was created by Christoph Bober in order to use the .ino file - you'll find it on his site here: \r\nhttp:\/\/www.christophbober.com\/?p=70\r\n(I just put the .h and the .cpp file in the same directory as the .ino but I believe there are more elegant ways to do it.)\r\nCurrently in the duino code - I have only 2 switches are controlling 2 motors.  There really needs to be 4 switch inputs. However, It provides a starting point from which to evolve your control solution.\r\n\r\nI started writing a build steps manual - I've uploaded a PDF of the build steps document at it's current state of completion.  Further updates expected.\r\n\r\nAn additional stiffener support is needed between the Hip_Harness_Attchmt and the Hip_Motor_Mount. A section of aluminium extrusion to act as a stiffener on the harness will ensure the hip motor movement transfers to the leg rather than causing the harness to crumple.\r\n\r\nYou can use this project as a starting point, if you choose to implement voice control from a smartphone or inertial referencing - I won't try to stop you :o)  -- Just remember to share.\r\nFor those who need it, this is a quality of life thing.\r\n\r\nI re-used some things I found on Thingiverse - modified them etc.  If you deserve credit for any work here please let me know.

The default is Lo but Hi force will increase the activation force by approximately 66 grams force for the 35mm switch.\r\n* Since the **LilyPad Button Board** is available in two PCB thicknesses I added an option for **Thin or Thick**. The **default is Thin** (.8mm) as supplied by **SparkFun Electronics**. However the **Thick** setting will change the base part standoff height to accommodate a 1.6mm PCB thickness (as found on Amazon and elsewhere in the internet). \r\n* Since **Thingiverse Customizer** is still unreliable, I have posted **more STL file options** to make it easier to download the  size and button style you prefer. There are now 12 file options: **small, med and large** each with a choice of **convex or concave button** style. Of course you can still download the **OpenSCAD source file** and open it in the OpenSCAD application to use the built-in customizer for access to all the parameters.\r\n\r\n### **DIYAT Switch V4 Specifications:**\r\n* **Switching capacity:** 1 to 50 mA, 5 - 24 VDC (resistive load)\r\n* **Activation surface:** approximately 199 - 1655 square mm (smallest to largest outside diameter parameter)\r\n* **Activation force:** approximately 204 - 248 grams force (largest to smallest outside diameter parameter; measured with digital scale near center of button; less force required with larger button due to mechanical advantage)\r\n* **Activation distance:** approximately 0.25 mm (as per SparkFun Mini Pushbutton Switch - SMD specifications)\r\n\r\n**Discription**\r\nThis is a simple passive **Do It Yourself Assistive Technology** switch enclosure similar to **DIYAT V5** (https:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:3146646). The major difference is the switch used in the enclosure. This version uses a very small **\"Lilypad Button Board\"** with low activation force and capable of signal level switching, \r\n\r\nThis three part enclosure (no screws) makes a small momentary tactile button switch more durable and accessible by providing protection and a larger activation surface. Designed with **OpenSCAD**, this parametric design allows selecting the build diameter, base style (plain or strap mounting) and button style (recessed or protruding). STL files for the small, medium and large sizes are provided for convenience. For other options use the **Customizer**. Make sure the custom diameter setting matches each of the three parts saved to insure they fit together. This version features a threaded latch and uses **radial flexures** for frictionless activation. Although it is frictionless, there is resistance from the flexures which increases the activation force slightly. Here's how the flexure works: https:\/\/youtu.be\/2EqkSfG4u5U\r\n\r\n**Note:** the switch used in this design is good for signal level switching (loads under 50mA) as is the case for any AT switch based on a PCB style tactile switch. For inductive loads, such as motorized toys that have been switch adapted, be aware of the load current. It can easily exceed 50mA. For loads up to 5 amps look at my **DIYAT Switch V5**. Although considerably larger, the microswitch used in V5 still has low activation force,\r\n\r\nThe DIYAT Switch is designed to be simple to build, durable, inexpensive (minimal parts) and customizable in size and style. This design is an assembly of three parts that fit together and must be printed with enough precision to operate correctly.

This is in the same way that Robotic grippers and end-effectors are designed for a specific goal.\r\n\r\nThe Black Ram Hand is designed to help those with missing fingers or conditions such as Dupuytren's Contracture. It is wrist powered and requires that the wearer have enough palm to push against the device. It converts the rotation of the wrist into a linear sliding motion to activate the end gripper. When the wrist is bent down the slider pulls back, closing the hand. When the wrist is straightened the slider pushes forward and the hand opens.\r\n\r\nThe Gripper heads are removable so that the user can change them and reconfigure the device to suit their needs. I have created 2 Claw types, Tri-Claw (for picking up or catching objects) and Two-claw (for open shut grasping of objects). New claw or manipulator types can be attached with 2 screws on the hand piece. Within these you can add any flavor of gripper suitable. I have added a few grippers as extras for people to try. I recommend that you start with the Simple Claw to get the feel of the device before printing the other variants.\r\n\r\nThe multi-joint finger requires the user to tune the fingers.

The first thing I noticed was a mind-numbing variety of available pressure switches with huge amounts of overlap in functionality and features.  They\u2019re also hugely expensive.  It was difficult to understand why a particular manufacturer chose to incorporate a particular feature set into their switch, but once incorporated, there was little or no support for customization.\r\n\r\nWhile researching and writing my master's project, I happened to purchase a 3D Printer and immediately saw the opportunity that 3D printing created for low cost, one-off (personalized), manufacturing.  The technology is also simple enough to use that it could be put into the hands of people close to the individuals with disabilities \u2013 OTs, PTs, ATPs, and even families.\r\n\r\nThe switch design here is intended only as a proof of concept (POC) or as an existence proof.  Every design element and decision could be improved upon and I hope it will.  The purpose of this design is only to get the conversation started.The Volksswitch has goals in terms of cost, functionality and reliability but simultaneously aspires to high levels of customization and personalization \u2013 a capability which is only now feasible via the technology of 3D printing.

Its goal is to give these persons the ability to test and prototype prosthetic arm extensions and search for the right dimensions and positioning. All of the toolkit's components were designed to be 3D printed, laser cut or are off-the-shelf available. In this way, a tailored and custom-made Assistive Tool can be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe Toolkit is extremely useful in a rehabilitation environment, as it allows the occupational therapists, patients and other thirds to co-create custom-made DIY-Assistive Technology, perfectly fitting the needs of one patient.

A mechanical braille embosser cost over a 1000$USD and an electronic goes from 3000$ up to 5000$. I tough about making one for a friend but I couldn't find a DIY version, so I decided to make one myself. This isn\u2019t, by any means, a finish product. By making the machine an open source project, I am hoping others will improve the design. In a near future, with the help of others makers, OpenBraille will reduce the cost of these printers and it will allow anyone with a visual imparity to read and write. So, if you know someone, if you are a maker, if you are curious or if you want to help out, please feel free to follow this tutorial and help me built a community around OpenBraille.\r\nThe encoder is pretty much the heart of the embosser. Most of the commercial machines emboss the dots by impacting the sheet. Because it\u2019s harder to build a precise machine out of 3D printed parts, I designed a different system. Instead of impacting and applying all the energy in a single hit, OpenBraille uses a physical encoder and a roller.

It's also an improvement to the pill containers that have snap-on covers that may be hard to remove for some people as well as being hard to get the pills out. The container is shaped as a heptagon for each day of the week and as you rotate the pill container, the pills in the slot for the next day will fall out onto a plate that can easily be grabbed. The container is simply rotated by spinning the top or sides of the design clockwise. This allows people with limited hand or wrist mobility to easily rotate it to get the pills that they may need for the day. The top of the container, which is the part that allows you to spin it, has openings to allow you to easily put pills in by dropping it in the day of the week that you need it. The pill container consists of four parts which are individually 3D printed and assembled. The only thing that you need is a few drops of glue or adhesive to hold a couple of the parts together in a very simple and explained 5 step process.

Currently, we are developing Braille Bluetooth Keyboards that can either be part of a phone case for both Android and Apple smartphones or as a wallet sized standalone that can be connected to any Bluetooth enabled device like a tablet, phone, or computer to be used as a fully functional keyboard and navigation device.\r\nSmartphones are becoming increasingly empowering for the blind community: screen readers speak the contents of websites and e-books to readers, recent developments are enabling computers to generate descriptions of what is happening in an image, and speech recognition technologies are becoming better, allowing users to express themselves quickly online with text.\r\nBut speaking out what you want to type is not always appropriate, and it can be frustrating when it doesn't work well. What are the alternatives for fast typing on a smartphone as a blind user? You could carry around a large keyboard with you, buy an incredibly expensive refreshable Brailler, or use a specialized app with virtual buttons and then copy over the text to the original app: all unsatisfactory solutions. This is why we propose the BrailleTooth, a phone case with integrated Braille Bluetooth keyboard that lets blind users type quickly using physical buttons while maintaining a reasonable price point which is a fraction of the current Braillers on the market.\r\nThe problem our idea addresses is easier accessibility for the blind. The case provides a physical Braille keyboard on the back so that the visually impaired can type on their phones without needing the phone to tell them what key is under their finger. It is time-consuming for the visually impaired to type well using a touchscreen - we found a way to change that.\r\nHere is a video demonstration of our iPhone Brailler\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4Mw84fKFbIw\r\n\r\n#ASSISTIVETECH\r\n"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:6640383","description":"This is a remix of the nicely designed Plug Puller by WATAP.

It interfaces with any standard 3.5mm mono jack system, commonly found in support situations for people living with physical disabilities.\r\n\r\nAT buttons are a way for someone with a limited range of motion to control his or her environment at the same level as anyone else. These buttons can be used to adapt toys and home appliances such that they can be actuated with ease. Most AT buttons available are quite expensive, and are engineered to be used in serious -- 100% reliability -- situations. As a result there are a lot of [DIY projects](http:\/\/www.instructables.com\/id\/CD-Switch\/) to make buttons meant for more relaxed use cases. We wanted to make a button that can be used for toy adapting and similar functions, while also providing a clean and durable design.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nThis button was created as part of a team-based senior design course. We worked with a local organization, [UCP and TASC of Huntsville](http:\/\/ucphuntsville.org\/what-we-do\/t-a-s-c\/), to design and construct an AT keyboard and AT button.\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\nMaking one button takes me about 8 hours of printing and 1 hour of assembly.\r\n\r\n### Materials\r\n\r\n* [Cherry MX Switch](https:\/\/mechanicalkeyboards.com\/shop\/index.php?l=product_list&c=43)\r\n* [3.5mm Mono Port](http:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/TOOGOO-Chassis-Female-Socket-Connectors\/dp\/B00EZIGTYY?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage)\r\n* 6\" or so of wire\r\n* Optional: [Compression spring](https:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/Everbilt-Spring-Assortment-Kit-84-Pack-13554\/203133714) for adjusting the button's actuation force.\r\n* Optional: [3.5mm Mono cable](http:\/\/www.mycablemart.com\/store\/cart.php?m=product_list&c=178) to connect the button to things\r\n* Optional: drawer\/shelf\/toolbox liner **or** dual-lock **or** velcro as a grip base\r\n\r\n### Assembly\r\n* Print the button base, button hatch, and and key cap.\r\n* Solder the MX switch to the mono port with two pieces of wire, about 3 inches each.\r\n* Install the MX switch in the middle of the button base, and then run the mono jack to the port on the flat side. Screw the mono port's threads into the hole in the side of the button.\r\n* Jam the key cap onto the cherry MX switch. This can optionally be done with a light spring over the switch stem to adjust the force of the button. \r\n* Optionally glue or bolt (M3 bolts) the shelf liner to the bottom of the button to make a no-slip base!\r\n\r\nCan also optionally have superglue to hold things together.\r\n\r\n## Doing Things With AT Button\r\n\r\nHere I'm just running through some small use cases that I've personally found for this button.\r\n\r\n### Control a computer via an Arduino\r\n\r\nYou can use a [small firmware](https:\/\/github.com\/ctag\/cpe495\/tree\/master\/button_test\/button_test) on an arduino along with a [shell script](https:\/\/github.com\/ctag\/cpe495\/tree\/master\/button_test\/button_test) to automate tasks on your computer. In the example code the shell script uses xdotool to generate a Right arrow key press, which allows me to use the button to advance slides in a power point.\r\n\r\n### Control a computer via microphone input\r\n\r\nYou can also wire the button directly to a computer's microphone and detect button presses. This is still something we're looking into, and hope to return with more robust code.\r\n"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:3716666","description":"This is a thing UNDER CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nNext weeks we will upload new files.\r\n\r\nThis assistive technology has been developed by the Research and Development Group of Assistive Technology of the Federal University of S\u00e3o Carlos (NTA \/ UFSCar \/ Sorocaba), Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe research group thanks the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for the funding of the Vert\u00e1til Project (Process No. 442261 \/ 2016-0), the research collaborators and the State Education Network of Sorocaba."},{"index":"https:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:4940298","description":"FRENCH\r\nMerci de lire l'avertissement en cliquant sur le profil.\r\n\r\nLe scanner 3D Pop de Revopoint est un appareil permettant de scanner tout type de formes dont des parties du corps humain.

Printing the models with the planes of the printed layers orthogonal to the normal direction of loading may cause the printed parts to be ripped apart between the layers.\r\n\r\nTo use: \r\n1. Unfold the collapsed bag holder\r\n2. Insert the narrow width of your wrist into the top handle labelled \"PART 1\"\r\n3. Turn your wrist to secure the bag holder on your wrist, preventing it from slipping off.\r\n4. Position the handle(s) of the bag(s) you want to carry in the middle of the lower jaw labelled \"PART 3\". Positioning the handle(s) of your bag(s) in the middle of the lower jaw will help to evenly distribute the weight of the bag(s) for a more comfortable experience.\r\n\r\nFuture modifications:\r\n+ Apply a fillet to the underside of the top handle.

While a number of telescoping \"grabbers\" existed on the market (claws, adhesive, magnetic), none were specialized to pick up tiny items with the geometry of prescription medicine.\r\n\r\nNote:  The grabber head was printed with NinjaFlex and the connector part was printed with ABS, though PLA should work.\r\n\r\nWe used an existing tool for the telescoping handle.

One particular teacher had this idea:\r\n\r\n\"My idea would help with the organization and storage of equipment that is used by students with hearing loss. We provide FM equipment to approximately 200 students in 13 districts, so we have a large inventory of equipment to organize. The FM systems are used by students in schools to help improve their auditory access to instruction (in other words, it amplifies sound to help them hear their teachers better). Many of the pieces of equipment are small enough to be organized within plastic craft organizers, but we would like to improve our storage of the FM microphones\/transmitters.\r\n\r\nBasically, it's a drawer divider that would be a custom size to hold the transmitter units. We currently use very old foam that was used for shipping some equipment that we no longer use, but it has helped us store the pieces more securely than just having to put them all together in one drawer.\"\r\n\r\nI designed these 3-D printable boxes as a solution to this problem.

Traditional breast prostheses are usually expensive, heavy, sweaty, and uncomfortable. They typically require special bras or camisoles with pockets, and they can\u2019t be worn for many weeks after surgery. Knitted Knockers, however, are soft, comfortable, beautiful, and when placed in a regular bra - they take the shape and feel of a real breast. Knitted Knockers can be adjusted to fill a gap for uneven breasts, and they are easily adapted for those going through reconstruction by simply removing some of the stuffing.\r\n\r\n**Materials**\r\n1 set 6\u201d double point needles, size US 5 or 6.

You can use a single or double strand of yarn.\r\n\r\nI made this design myself. If you know how to crochet this will be easy for you to do! There  is a bit of increasing, but it is not necessary if you are beginner, if you are familiar with increasing then you can follow my directions in the video tutorial. \r\n\r\nThere is no specific right or wrong way to make these. shorter pads for lighter days\/ panty liners can be as short as 10 rows for the chain when starting the pad. It is also good to have your underwear handy as this will also determine the width of the pad. Increasing is done near the back in of the pad and is best used for overnight pads ( chain about 25 to 30 rows depending on your flow\/ and if you have given birth). It is very versatile to fit your needs.\r\n\r\ncrochet hook- listed as 4.5mm I used a 4.25mm but I am sure either works just fine- for single strand\r\n\r\ndouble strand use a 5.5 or larger.\r\n\r\nI actually sew all the pad pieces together. I often do small squares of SC for the wings and attach later.\r\n\r\nSome basic sewing involved can do hand or machine. I prefer hand sewing.\r\n\r\nSewing materials needed- I used old underwear, t shirts and 100% cotton material to use as the top and bottom of the pads with the crochet part in the middle acting as the core. But you can choose flannel for the bottom or top. I do not suggest a heavy fabric though- this ensures better results when washing the pads. Sewing needles, scissors or rotary cutter, etc\r\n\r\nThese pads are amazing!!!!

I DO NOT recommend trying to recreate this without a pattern, unless you or someone close to you can test the product. If it is made and too tight, this will cause the fistula\/graft to fail.

The term was coined by Christine Miserandino when she used spoons to explain the fatigue her lupus caused. A spoonie only gets a limited number of spoons (energy) each day and each day is different. If you start out your day with only 8 or 9 spoons and it takes a spoon to shower, another to get dressed, another for breakfast, and another to drive to work or the grocery store or take the kids to school, it is difficult to get through the day. It becomes necessary to weigh each decision\u2014\u201cIf I get a shower, will I still have enough energy to wash a load of clothes so we have clothes for tomorrow?\u201d Or\u2014\u201cIf I go grocery shopping today, we are going to have to get takeout tonight because I won\u2019t have enough spoons left to cook let alone clean the kitchen afterward.\u201d\r\n\r\nFibromyalgia introduced me to the spoonie world. Summer air conditioning and fans are painful for me when the air hits my hands. I needed something I could carry with me and use just on my wrists and top of my hands where cold air causes pain. These are perfect for adding protection right where I need it without causing more pain. I hope you also find them useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notes on Fit:**\r\nMy hands are often swollen and my skin signals pain at the slightest touch, so the loose cozies are made to fit quite loosely. The loose cozies on size 7 needles have about an inch of ease for my comfort level. (30stitches on size 7 needles.)  \r\n\r\nHowever, these were big on several of my testers. The close fit  feels okay on me, but not when my allodynia is active. For those with even smaller wrists or who want an even closer fit, I would suggest using size 6 needles instead. The great thing is that these are a quick knit so knitting multiple sizes is easy. \r\n\r\nA swatch is not recommended because one of these actually has fewer stitches than a swatch would. Knit one and try it on to see before you cut your yarn to find the best size.\r\n\r\nThere are also 2 optional rows which you can add as many times as you like to make your cozies longer.\r\n"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/braille-birthday-scarf","description":"This pattern will knit to chunky weight yarn but I have found that doubling DK gives much better definition of the pattern than using single chunky weight yarn.

In Kindergarten, my eyesight began to decline rapidly and I had to start wearing some pretty powerful lenses very early on in my youth. My own mother experienced severe hearing loss while I was a young girl as well. So I easily identified with the visual and hearing impairment that Helen experienced. Her impairments were of course much more life changing than mine, but I always admired her for her determination to not let anything stop her from communicating with the world around her. She advocated strongly for the rights of the deaf and blind and she helped influence the spread of the use of Braille to help bring literacy to the blind.\r\nThis shawl is my tribute to Helen and the great things she accomplished. Did you know that she even knitted and crocheted when the weather was inclement? The small bobbles in the middle section are not just randomly placed. They are an accurate knitted representation of Braille. If you know this amazing form of writing, you can read the famous quote by Helen Keller herself:\r\n\u201cThe best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.\u201d\r\nI chose lace hearts and cable hearts to surround the quote, because the visually impaired can easily feel these raised and lacey stitches and can be reminded of the love felt by those who care for them.\r\nI hope you enjoy knitting it as much as I enjoyed designing it!\r\n\r\nKnitting Skills used:\r\nBrioche\r\nSimple Lace\r\nCables\r\nBobbles\r\nIcord\r\n\r\nVideo tutorials are provided as links in this pattern to help with all of these skills.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s stay in touch!

Perfect for mini skeins and leftovers ! \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to knit them with bigger wool, focus on the yardage required, and adapt the needle size (advices are given in the pattern).\r\n\r\nAs shown in pictures, The Nibbles are knitted with Ovis et cetera Close for the bunnies and Ovis et cetera Igneae (for the garments). \r\n\r\nAs for all my patterns, the process is thought for the maker\u2019s happiness of having a character truly emerging during the knitting, a very lively little soul appearing at a early stage of the making then growing organically stitch by stitch. \r\n- No seaming.\r\n- No assembling.\r\n- All the finishing done as you go, and face features added right from the beginning.\r\nWhen you\u2019re done with the last stitch, you\u2019re done with your little woolly friend too.\r\n\r\nThe Nibbles pattern has been carefully tested and fully tech edited. \r\n\r\n- About the difficulty level : i would rate it between advanced beginners and intermediate. The only true prerequisite is knowing how to knit small circumferences in the round (either with magic loop or DPNs). On this basis, I worked at providing detailed instructions as well as extra tips to offer a very smooth process. \r\n\r\nSIZE\r\nWith the yarn and needle size used for the sample shown, a tiny bunny measure about 12 cm (4,75 inches) from the top of the head to the sole of the little feet. If you use a thicker yarn, you will get a bigger bunny. In that case, don\u2019t forget to adapt the size of the eyes if you use safety eyes.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC NOTIONS\r\nStuffing, safety eyes (as shown here, from 4,5mm to 6 mm diameter dark brown), embroidery floss\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT RESERVATIONS \r\n\u00a9 Cinthia Vallet\r\nThis pattern is intended for your personal non-commercial use only.

They are used for sensory stimulation and seem to help calm the people who use them. \r\n\r\nLots of different things can be added to the muffs for stimulation - pony beads can be knitted in, fabric ribbons can be used, bath puffs can be sewn on, little items like stress balls, can be sewn on after the muff is made. Look for things in the kid's section of stores. Be careful with what you add though, because anything with sharp edges can tear fragile skin. Items like metal nuts and screws from the hardware store are not really appropriate for these.  Also, sometimes the plastic beads have very rough edges too. Be aware that sometimes people put things like this in their mouths, so be sure that anything you do sew on is secure. \r\n\r\nTo add texture to the muff, consider using a furry or fuzzy yarn as one of the strands as you knit. Even small amounts of a novelty yarn add lots of texture to these. \r\n\r\nPlease consider donating items made from this pattern to your local Alzheimer Association, area Assisted Living units, or Assisted living centers for dementia patients.

Children must be left free to explore the world. It\u2018s in this context that sensory materials take shape, they aren\u2019t just games but tools to help the child in the initial period of his life in which he has a particular need to perform sensory activities. \r\nWith Montessori materials children develop their cognitive powers through direct experience:\u00a0seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, and movement. I designed this cube so that it could reflect the characteristics of Montessori materials: natural and quality materials,  simple and realistic shapes, each cube face dedicated to a single activity linked to  a precise sensation to give to the child. A simple and safe toy with which the child can interact freely and that will grow with him. \r\n\r\nThe cube consists of 6 faces crocheted separately and then joined wit a round of simple crochet stitches.  \r\n\r\nI made this cube for my 8 month old niece, since she is attracted by any sounds and she likes rattles then I inserted a rattle box inside the  sun and the cloud but you can quietly not put them, it\u2019s your free choice\r\n\r\nThis cube is of 12 cm\/ 5\u201d in side and 24 cm\/10 \u201c in height.

I used yarn thicknesses reaching from DK to chunky and needle sizes of US 1 - 2 (metric 2.5 mm) , US 4 (metric 3.5 mm) and US 8 (metric 5 mm).\r\n\r\nThe pattern consists of knit and purl stitches, bobbles, stranded colour work, slipped stitches and yarn overs. The muff is knitted in the flat and the edges are joined after completion. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this pattern is suitable for intermediate knitters. Each step is explained here (I included stitch techniques and dog making and finishing instructions), and I am happy to help with any questions. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy creating a similar muff, they are one-in-a-million pieces and will make someone you know very happy and much less anxious. Enjoy and happy knitting!"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/foongus-fidget","description":"This pattern is intended for personal use only. (Not mass production).

The weight amount of yarn used is exact, but I rounded up when converting that to yards, just to be on the safe side. How much you will use largely depends on your personal tension. I have found that others using this yarn weight often pick an 8mm hook, but because my natural tension is loose (blame it on years of just crocheting blankets), I sized my hook down to a 7mm and that worked well for me. If your tension is tight, you might want to try the 8mm. Just note that the \u201cstar\u201d placement on the blue side may need to shift a bit.

We had learned through our experience with Alzheimer\u2019s that sensory played a part in brain stimulation. We thought we could bring together sensory stimulation and the warmth and coziness of a jumper together, the idea for the textured sensory blanket was born. \r\nThe idea behind this blanket is that loved ones will be able to make a gift that will be both practical and personal. This pattern provides ways to personalise the blanket from the choice of the yarn to the additional attachments on certain squares.\r\nThere are two mesh squares where ribbons, yarn or even fabric from an old shirt could be weaved in and out to provide extra texture and personalisation.

Which defeats the purpose right?? Right!\r\n\r\nSo in all honesty I was still left with so many scraps so I decided to try and tackle them with an extra fun, sassy and scrappy beanie hat pattern that really tackles those scraps. Plus each one would be an original! A special, one of a kind creation, which could make a unique and useful gift!\r\n\r\nThe Sassy Bit - The \u2018Odd Ball\u2019\r\n\r\nLook for that odd ball that I know you have  \r\n\r\nThis is for that half used ball of yarn, a colour that you don\u2019t have anymore of. So it will be some yarn that you have left over, where there is not quite enough of it to make anything on its own, but it is definitely more than just scrappy bits. This you can use as your main colour.\r\n\r\nThis part of the design is what I described as the \u2018Sassy\u2019 part.\r\n\r\nSo while you are still using up scrap, you are thinking ahead, adding a bit of pre-planned style by using a continuous main colour in-between all your other scrappy bits. This also makes all the different colours of your beanie pop\u2019!\r\n\r\nThe Scrappy Bit - The \u2018Odds & Sods\u2019\r\n\r\nNow we get to dig into that bag of \u2018Odds & Sods'\r\n\r\nYup, those little bits of yarn that are randomly thrown into a bag, because, you know\u2026  \u2018I might still need it one day\u2019  \r\n\r\nGather those bits together, and roll each colour into little balls, and put them in a bag or basket, keeping another empty bag or basket on the side. When you start adding your scrappy bits to the pattern, grab your colour randomly (I.e without looking), and when you finish adding that scrappy colour, you put the used scrappy ball into your second bag\/basket, keeping it separate from the unused scrappy balls. This ensures that you don\u2019t use the same scrap colour too close to the last time it was used. You repeat this method until your first bag\/basket is empty and then you switch the bag\/basket around. And then yes,  you guessed it, you simply start randomly selecting your colours again, repeating the process.\r\n\r\nYou can have as many or as few colours as you like! This also saves tons of time trying to choose colours that work together (no more over thinking).\r\n\r\nThere is such a freeing feeling to just trust the process, and randomly choose colours. What is even more satisfying is the stunning surprise end result!\r\n\r\nBelow you will find an estimated yarn quantity required for each scrappy yarn colour row and also the amount for the main colour, so you can be prepared ahead.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, have fun while making your very own, one of a kind \u2018Sassy Scrappy Beanie\u2019!\r\n"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/cal-priscilla-shawl","description":"**SLOVAK**\r\nPo\u010fme si spolo\u010dne op\u00e4\u0165 uh\u00e1\u010dkova\u0165 \u0161atku - CAL bude prebieha\u0165 na Facebook v skupine MARTINA SUPOVA DESIGN  prichystajte si potrebn\u00fd materi\u00e1l - 1000m \u010darovn\u00e9 klbko + h\u00e1\u010dik - a za\u010d\u00edname v nede\u013eu 02.03.2025 prvou \u010das\u0165ou.\r\nN\u00e1vod sa bude sklada\u0165 z 3 \u010dast\u00ed, ktor\u00e9 bud\u00fa postupne zverejnen\u00e9  bude popri p\u00edsanej forme obsahova\u0165 aj sch\u00e9mu a  jednotliv\u00e9 \u010dasti bud\u00fa v slovenskom, anglickom a nemeckom jazyku.\r\n\r\nOdpor\u00fa\u010dan\u00fd materi\u00e1l:\r\nH\u00e1\u010dik  \u2013 3,5 mm \r\n1 klbko Magic Balls \u2013 250g\/1000m \u2013 50% bavlna, 50% polyakryl  - 4nitka od ColorfulLmadeshop (na fotke Metropolis - Sun City) -  \r\n\r\nZ 1000m klbka v\u00e1m vyjde \u0161atka o ve\u013ekosti 160x80cm  Nako\u013eko je vzor opakovate\u013en\u00fd aj viackr\u00e1t ako bude v n\u00e1vode na z\u00e1kladn\u00fa ve\u013ekos\u0165 - m\u00f4\u017eete pou\u017ei\u0165 aj klbko s vy\u0161\u0161\u00edm n\u00e1vinom pre dosiahnutie v\u00e4\u010d\u0161ej \u0161atky.\r\n\r\nZA\u010c\u00cdNAME 02.03.2025\r\n\r\n**ENGLISH**\r\nLet's crochet a scarf together again - CAL will take place on Facebook in the MARTINA SUPOVA DESIGN group  prepare the necessary material - 1000m magic ball + hook - and we start on Sunday 02.03.2025 with the first part.\r\nThe instructions will consist of 3 parts, which will be published gradually  in addition to the written form, it will also contain a diagram and the individual parts will be in Slovak, English and German.\r\n\r\nRecommended material:\r\nHook \u2013 3.5 mm\r\n1 ball of Magic Balls \u2013 250g\/1000m \u2013 50% cotton, 50% polyacrylic - 4 threads from ColorfulLmadeshop (in the photo Metropolis - Sun City) -\r\n\r\nA 1000m ball will make you a scarf measuring 160x80cm  Since the pattern can be repeated more times than in the instructions for the basic size - you can also use a ball with a higher winding to achieve a larger scarf.\r\n\r\nWE START 02.03.2025\r\n\r\n**DEUTSCH**\r\nLasst uns wieder zusammen einen Schal h\u00e4keln - der CAL findet auf Facebook in der Gruppe MARTINA SUPOVA DESIGN statt  Ben\u00f6tigtes Material - 1000m Magic Ball + H\u00e4kelnadel - bereitlegen und schon starten wir am Sonntag, den 02.03.2025 mit dem ersten Teil.\r\nDie Anleitung besteht aus 3 Teilen, die nach und nach ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden  Sie enth\u00e4lt neben der schriftlichen Form auch ein Diagramm und die einzelnen Teile sind in Slowakisch, Englisch und Deutsch verfasst.\r\n\r\nEmpfohlenes Material:\r\nHaken \u2013 3,5 mm\r\n1 Kn\u00e4uel Magic Balls \u2013 250g\/1000m \u2013 50% Baumwolle, 50% Polyacryl \u2013 4 F\u00e4den von ColorfulLmadeshop (im Foto Metropolis \u2013 Sun City) \u2013\r\n\r\nAus einem 1000m Kn\u00e4uel wird ein Schal mit den Ma\u00dfen 160x80cm  Da sich das Muster \u00f6fter wiederholen kann, als es die Anleitung f\u00fcr die Grundgr\u00f6\u00dfe vorgibt, kann auch ein Kn\u00e4uel mit h\u00f6herer Wicklung verwendet werden, um einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Schal zu erhalten.\r\n\r\nWIR STARTEN AM 02.03.2025"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/therefore-mittens","description":"**Therefore Mittens** are knitted in the round, from cuff up to the fingertips, with a few options for the cuff: short, long or with a split.

His friend and ally had posted pictures of the crocheted packer she'd made him as a replacement.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had to figure out what a packer was (which didn't take long - there were pictures). Then I had to ask a friend who is an LPN in inpatient mental health why packers might be taken away. This led to a long and winding conversation with him, contacts in the trans community, and several others, which in turn led to the organization of [Dongalong 2019][1]: a month long knitalong\/crochetalong campaign to design, produce, and distribute five dozen packers and two dozen pairs of knockers (breast forms) to trans and non-binary youth and adults in our area for the holidays.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Dongalong story was [picked up by the local newspaper][2] and CBC radio and from there spread to other parts of Nova Scotia and other provinces entirely. I'm super excited to see that there are knitters and crocheters in other parts of the country who are either planning to make packers and knockers to donate locally or even to organize their own Dongalongs.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNeed help, support, information, or resources related to being LGBTQ2S? [Check out the NS Youth Project.][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n**About the packer pattern itself:**\r\n\r\nThe patterns for packers (or packer-like objects) I found online were either comically shaped for gag gifts or oversized for drag kings. Larger than life is fine for special occasions, but I wanted to make packers a realistic size and shape for every day, casual wear. This pattern should result in a packer that's right around the size of average male genitalia (see notes in the pattern), but instructions are included to make it larger or smaller if desired. Gauge and yarn choice will also determine finished size.\u00a0\r\n\r\nETA: \r\n\r\nNow that packers and knockers are coming in from a variety of crocheters, I\u2019ve realized that my gauge is tighter than most peoples\u2019. I\u2019ve added my gauge numbers to the stats above and closeups of my fabric to the photos so that you can see how firm the fabric needs to be so that the stuffing doesn\u2019t show through. I find it difficult to crochet a fabric this firm with a wooden hook and have switched to metal hooks because of this.\r\n\r\nAlso\/soon to be available:\r\n\r\n[knit packer pattern][4]\r\n[crocheted knocker pattern][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/723522851492468\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/www.capebretonpost.com\/lifestyles\/local-lifestyles\/dongalong-in-sydney-helping-provide-packers-knockers-for-transgender-non-binary-people-378163\r\n  [3]: https:\/\/youthproject.ns.ca\/resources\/resources-and-information\/\r\n  [4]: https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/knit-packer\r\n  [5]: https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/quick--easy-round-knocker"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/princess-lola","description":"* There are kits for Princess Lola Socks available here:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/724091322\/princess-lola-kit *\r\n\r\n**Lola loves a lovely sock, but her feet are oh so delicate and only princess soles will do \u2026so I\u2019ve designed her a sock that has purl stitches on the outside so her foot can tread daintily on smooth knit stitches.**\r\n\r\n**Princess Lola Socks are worked from the toe up with a decorative gusset and sturdy slipped stitch heel (even princesses wear out their socks!).

Komen foundation, but after hearing many touching stories of the comfort it gave both knitter and receiver, I wanted to open up the potential for giving by making the pattern free. Thanks to all who donated via purchase previously, and thank you to all who might make this pattern as a way to give.\r\n\r\nFeather Light, Cozy Warm, Easy and Portable \r\nPattern revised to include two shapes.\r\nBe sure to try and get close to gauge on this pattern or your shawl will be smaller than you might wish. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a tight knitter, uses about 220 yards\r\n\r\nPeople who have had shoulder injuries, or older folks who are a little frail can be very vulnerable to cold, yet find heavy shoulder coverings uncomfortable. People receiving cancer treatment sometimes feel very chilled, and any extra weight can feel like a burden. This shawl will keep them warm, with almost no added weight. \r\n\r\nThe curved back and neckline means the shawl sits securely on the shoulders, and does not roll or fold uncomfortably against the back when seated. It has the added advantage of being extremely compressible, so it can be smooshed into a small container for travel and will be just as fluffy and warm when it\u2019s taken out for use.\r\n\r\nGreat for using your own handspun yarn, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a worsted or Aran weight yarn and smaller needles:\r\n\r\n1: skip the first 6 rows, and begin by casting on 17 stitches (otherwise the neck portion will be uncomfortably small) then begin with row 7.  \r\n2: Use the variation for larger framed people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3: just continue to knit rows 1 and 2 from the second half of the shawl until the knitter feels it is long enough. :-}\r\n\r\nToo long makes it awkward for wheel chair users, so I suggest it be no longer than 13 inches when measured down the spine. Since it will stretch a bit from its own weight, I usually start my bind off when it measures between 12 1\/2 to 12 3\/4 inches.\r\n\r\n"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/daylong-socks-both-ways","description":"Here's the the pattern for the socks with princess feet--the bottom of the heel, the sole of the foot, and the toe are all in reverse stockinette stitch. The smooth knit side of the stockinette faces inside against the sole of the foot for a more comfortable sock. The trick is that the foot is knit inside out. No additional purling is needed. The leg and instep are ribbed for a stretchy, comfy fit.\r\n\r\nThere are two versions, one for cuff-down socks with a heel flap and gusset and another for toe-up socks with a boomerang short-row heel. The simplicity of the pattern makes this an easy knit and allows these instructions to be used to reverse the foot of almost any sock pattern. Use Daylong Socks as a blueprint to improve the comfort of your next socks. \r\n\r\nAs a bonus, there is a supplemental pdf containing instructions for continuing the toe-up socks to knee-high length.

Prior to that date, this pattern was published as three separate patterns, including one longer version that provided instructions for both toe-up and cuff-down.  After revision, the longer version was eliminated. \r\n\r\nBoth versions and the Knee Socks Supplement are now available for free.  "},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/soft-packer","description":"Last December, I was inspired by Bethany's crochet soft packer [Lil' Bug Soft Packer][1] and the [Parts For People Volunteer Group][2], who make and donate soft packers and breast prosthetics for non-binary, transmasculine & transfeminine people, to come up with a pattern for a knitted soft packer. \r\n\r\nA soft packer is a prosthetic made to look like a non-erect penis and is used to create a bulge in a person\u2019s pants. Usually, most packers sold on the market are made out of silicone, which may not be an option for some, as it can sometimes be irritating, hot, sticky, heavy, expensive, etc. With this pattern, you can make your own packer and you can adjust the size, and the amount of stuffing to suit your needs. Overall, the materials can be found for more or less 15$, which makes it a great inexpensive alternative. \r\n\r\nIt is knit top-down (starts at the tip and finishes with testicles), no seaming, with an opening flap to allow stuffing and de-stuffing for washing the packer when needed. The opening is created with the afterthought method. The skills required to make this pattern includes: knits & purl, cast-on & bind-off, increasing & decreasing, working small circumferences in the round on circular needles with magic loop, knitting flat, short rows, putting stitches on a lifeline, picking up stitches.\r\n\r\n**Materials Needed**\r\n**Yarn** used is Aunt Lydia\u2019s crochet thread size 10, 100% mercerized cotton. You can use any size 10 cotton thread or smooth lace weight yarn that gives you the same gauge. I choose to use cotton fibers based on these recommendations; \r\n\u2022\tit is strong (mercerized cotton is stronger than regular cotton), so it will last longer. \r\n\u2022\tIt has less risks of allergies, which makes it a great choice for sensitive skin, and it is ideal if you are making it for someone that you don\u2019t know. \r\n\u2022\tIt takes dye really well.\r\n\u2022\tSize 10 cotton thread is easy to find in most craft stores and is less expensive than most fibers.\r\n\r\nYou will need around 137 to 183 meters of yarn (150 to 200 yards); plus a length of smooth scrap yarn in a contrasting color to insert lifelines.\r\n\r\n**Needles** Circular needles size US 0 \/ 2 mm with a 50 cm (20\u201d) cable or longer (as long as it\u2019s long enough to do a magic loop).\r\n\r\n**Filling** can be polyester fibers or plastic pellets or flaxseeds. See recommendations at the end.\r\n\r\n**Dye**, if you want to dye your packer to make it more realistic-looking.\r\n\r\n**Dimensions** of the packer pictured: Length from the tip to the base is 9,5 cm (3,75\u201d) and girth is 10 cm (4\u201d).\r\n\r\n**Gauge is:\r\n40 stitches and 60 rows make 10 cm by 10 cm in stockinette stitch worked in the round.**\r\n\r\n**Updated (March 7, 2020): This new version (V2) has now instructions on how to add a foreskin !**\r\n\r\nThe pattern has a light version (with 3 pictures, 8 pages); and another version with pictures at every step to guide you more easily through the pattern.\r\n\r\nI am planning to write a tutorial on how to dye your packer to get realistic skin tones just as I did for the packer in the pictures. \r\n\r\n**Tips:**\r\n\u2022\tYou can put the stuffing in a nylon sock before filling the packer in order to prevent the material from poking through the knitted fabric. You can fill your packer with fiber stuffing, plastic pellets, rice or flaxseeds. Feel free to experiment!\r\n\u2022\tWhen knitting in the round with cotton, expect laddering! Cotton is not stretchy like wool. A way I\u2019ve found to counteract laddering is to put the packer, once finished, 10-15 minutes in the drier. It will make the cotton stiffer and shrink a little bit, just enough to reduce the ladder, but be careful not to shrink it too much!\r\n\r\n**Wash and care:** Hand wash with delicate soap. Roll up in a towel to absorb excess water, shape and then lay flat to dry. \r\n\u00a9Marianne Fournier, 2020\r\n\r\n\r\n**- In regards to selling finished objects -** \r\n\r\nSome of you have written to me to ask if it was okay to sell packers using this pattern. I have no objection to it and I even encourage you to do it ! My wish for this pattern is to make breathable fabric packers more accessible to people in need. \r\nI\u2019d love it if this pattern can create opportunities for non-knitters to uplift and pay other trans people who knit.\r\n\r\nI would only appreciate that if a you are cis person that wants to knit packers for trans people, that you donate them in an act of charity rather than making money off trans issues. \r\nBut, those are suggestions and I do keep in mind that not only trans people need and use packers, as it was pointed to me in the comment.\r\n\r\nI trust you to use good judgement on those questions and on deciding the pricing as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n*I am sincerely touched by the positive and enthusiastic reception my pattern is getting and I thank you all for your kind comments,\r\nlove, \r\nMarianne (they\/them)*\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/lil-bug-soft-packer\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/936062173422167\/"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/morwenstowe","description":"The Morwenstowe Socks are a pair of two-colour socks featuring a lace and cable design, with instructions in three sizese\r\n\r\nThese socks are worked from the top down with a heel flap construction.

This pair of bed socks is thick and squishy.  It would be perfect for a person with swollen ankles, as they are not tight and would not dig in.  They would also work over a thinner pair of socks as house socks or slipper socks.  I chose an inexpensive and soft yarn that is easily washed by machine.  Any soft, washable wool or wool blend would be lovely as well.\r\n\r\nThis pattern will make a rather large pair of socks but an experienced sock knitter will easily be able to make them larger or smaller as needed.\r\n\r\nThe pattern is available [here][1]!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http:\/\/finngarianknits.wordpress.com\/2009\/12\/10\/big-squishy-bed-socks\/"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/eye-sore","description":"So I have an eye infection.

Also, seeing as I have a thing for writing up patterns, here's the pattern.\r\n\r\nThis is crocheted and knit."},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/big-people-slippers","description":"I\u2019ve wanted to design a pair of adult slippers for a long time. I want thick soles that won\u2019t easily wear out and can be worn alone or on top of socks. I want them to be fast and easy to make because if I wear them around the house a lot I know they will wear out.  The slippers are knit in one piece -- no seaming! \r\n\r\nMy slippers have a thick, slipped stitch sole, which is knit first. I don\u2019t like to do garter stitch for this because I have princess and the pea feet and it is often uncomfortable to walk on garter stitch -- unless the wool is soft, but then it doesn\u2019t last.  The construction is to knit the sole flat, then pick up around the edges of the sole using circular needles and\/or DPNs, and knit the top upwards in the round.  \r\n\r\n**The PDF download is the August 2010 update**.  I\u2019ve knitted quite a few of these slippers this summer to improve my design.  These are fitted slippers, and the number of stitches and rows you need depends on foot size and on the thickness of your yarn and needle size, so instead of describing the pattern stitch by stitch, I\u2019ve tried to describe it in a way that will allow you to understand the construction and customize your slippers for your own desired fit.  A cardboard cutout of the outline of the foot you are fitting will make this easier.\r\n\r\nUse any yarn that is thick and strong.  I use super bulky yarn and 6.5mm needles.  I use different yarns for the sole and the top.  For the sole, I might use a nice super bulky yarn along with a strand of very strong sock yarn with a good amount of nylon for strength.  Or, I might use a strand of nice strong yarn along with a strand of Phentex Slipper and Craft Yarn, which is a very strong, almost indestructible acrylic.  You are only going to use this for the sole; for the upper part of the slipper you can select a nice super bulky yarn with exciting colours. \r\n\r\nFor man-sized slippers I use about 60 - 70 yards of each sole yarn, and about 70 - 80 yards of super bulky yarn for the slipper tops.  \r\n"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/cold-breathing-mask","description":"Easy pattern for the child or adult with allergies or for the biker who has to travel dusty roads.\r\nERRATA: The original pattern has been revised and found several errors with it.

But when I couldn\u2019t find a pattern I liked, I had two choices, give up, or design my own.\r\n\r\nThe motif on the bottom echoes a \u201cgrupetto,\u201d a musical symbol indicating a trill or \u201cturn.\u201d Just like the grupetto adds flair to a line of music, cables add energy and movement to these gloves.\r\n\r\nMy main source of inspiration was the character Demyx from the Kingdom Hearts video game series.

However, because of all these surgeries, blood flow to the tip of his nose has been severely compromised, and because of this, it gets very cold, very quickly. Living in New England has not helped the situation, and the chilly winters are bitter and often turn his nose white with cold. He has tried scarves, facemasks and everything in between, but they often end up fogging up his glasses instead of warming his nose. I have tried many patterns and have finally succeeded in a \u201cnose cozy\u201d that my dad is ecstatic about, and allows him to shovel the snow, play with the dog, and get the mail without his nose freezing or fogging up his glasses. He can still wear a hat for extra ear warmth, although this does cover the ears, and a scarf for his chin, and it is perfect for the winter weather!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pattern is fairly easy and super quick!

Well, okay... not really, but they will solve all your mitten problems. With the top ribbing folded down, you've got fingerless mitts. With the ribbing up and the drawstring tied tight: you've got mittens, with none of the palm bulk, buttons, or drafts that come with fold-over-top style convertible mitts. Plus, you've got a bow. The thumb is a tube of ribbing that can be folded up or down. Great for commutes, chores, an evening out, or any time you need some mitten versatility.\r\n\r\nThe mitt features a horizontal stripe pattern in 2 colors of aran weight yarn. Some strategically placed slipped stitches form vertical stripes outlining the gusset and sides of the mitt. This is decorative, but also sneakily obscures the color jog at the start of each round that comes with knitting stripes in the round. Pattern includes complete written directions and charts of the palm and thumb gusset for each size. \r\n\r\n**Yarn:** 2 colors of aran weight yarn. Shown in Malabrigo Merino Worsted (210yds.\/192m., 3.53oz.\/ 100g.) (MC) 50 Roanoke and (CC) 27 Bobby Blue.

Circumference around palm of aprox. 7 in\/18cm (Small), 8 in\/20cm (Medium), 8.8 in\/22cm (Large).

Optional: I-cord, single crochet, or braiding (for drawstring).\r\n**Accessibility Notes:** All charted sections also written, 12 point serif font with bolded and underlined headings, no columns (except for abbreviation key). Due to unusual drawstring construction (no drafts!), they may be particularly useful to those with circulatory problems (such as Raynauds), especially when used as an additional layer over gloves. \r\n"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/instant-winter-socks-toe-up","description":"Create marled socks in custom colors using two strands of sock yarn.

I am the owner of Beala Designs where part of my love is knitting and crocheting. This shawl was designed for a friend who spends much of her time in a wheelchair. She needed a shawl that was not as likely to get bunched up in the small of her back or pinned under her tush (hence the missing point in the back) as a traditional triangular shawl. A rectangular wrap would have solved that problem, but I also wanted a shape that would cuddle her effortlessly and not fall off her shoulders. I chose Dreambaby yarn because it is super snuggly and it can be machine washed and dried--very important for someone in a care facility. \r\n\r\nThe pattern is worked from the bottom up making it very easy to adjust to suit any yarn weight and any size. Simply use the needle size recommended on the yarn label and stop knitting when the desired length is reached. Written instructions include notes to assist with such changes.\r\n\r\nI have included instructions for adding an optional half shell crochet border, but it's just as beautiful without a border! Many types of decorative borders would work well. Add your favorite to personalize it a bit. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this pattern and I look forward to seeing your pics! \r\n\r\nTHIS PATTERN (TEXT AND PHOTOS) ARE THE PROPERTY OF BEALA DESIGNS AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTED IN ANY FORMAT.

Other people need socks that do not restrict circulation to their feet or legs. The instructions in this pattern are written to create a pair of socks that are comfortable and healthy to wear. My son is diabetic and finds these socks really beneficial to his foot health.\r\n\r\nThe socks are knit from the top down and instructions are given for knitting in the round using 9\u201d circular needles, however the pattern can easily be converted to your favourite sock knitting method using DPNs or Magic Loop on longer circular needles.\r\n\r\nThis \u2018Sock Recipe\u2019 can be adapted to incorporate any \r\ndecorative stitch to enhance the look of your socks.

Includes 4 sizes: Adult S, L and XL, and the Bitty Bug for youths.\r\n\r\n* 4 Sizes\r\n* Full photo tutorial\r\n* Sized, shaped and stuffed to be anatomically proximal\r\n* Designed by a member of the trans community\r\n* Tested by the trans and non-binary community\r\n\r\n**The Lil' Bug story:**\r\nIn October 2019 I was looking for a pattern to make a soft packer for myself, after being frustrated by the cost and discomfort of silicone options. \r\n\r\nSilicone packers are expensive, heavy, and can get hot, sticky and uncomfortable. They come in limited sizes and colors, and unless worn with a strap, they weigh down clothing and don't stay put. They have to be powdered and cared for carefully, and even then only last about 6 months with daily wear. \r\n\r\nThe crochet options I found were oversized and comical, not designed to look good or be comfortable under clothing. I started to think making my own pattern might be necessary. I tried the free patterns I could find, and posted some photos in a large LGBTQ+ sewing group. Immediately I had 2 parents ask me if I could please make something like this for their young trans sons. After hearing from a mother who didn't know what else to do than just cry with her son, unsure how to ease his dysphoria with no options available for children, I decided to add the youth size to my pattern. The very first Bitty Bug packers I made were for 10 and 6 year old boys. I'm honored to have been a small part of their gender journey.\r\n\r\nI went on a mission to make a quality, comfortable packer that could be available to anyone in any shape, color, or size, and that they could make themselves. I designed, tested and refined the Lil' Bug with a group of friends and wonderful, experienced crochet testers. I sent them out to trans people to road test, and wore them myself. The resulting design is functional, comfortable, visually appropriate, and most importantly, feels good to wear. The presence that a packer has when worn is the most important part for most folks of addressing dysphoria.\r\n\r\n**Why isn't this pattern free?**\r\nIt is important to pay marginalized people for their creative work, and these small sales help support my queer family by covering a small part of the cost of providing packers for free. Accessibility is important to me, and if anyone needs it for free, please contact me.\r\n\r\n**Ways to Participate**\r\nI am committed to helping my community have access to the things we want and need. I hope you enjoy this pattern, and for those of you making these for trans friends and family - you rock!\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to make packers for the trans community?\r\n[The Parts For People Volunteer Facebook group][1]\r\n[The Soft Packer Project Ravelry group][2]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/936062173422167\/\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/groups\/the-soft-packer-project"},{"index":"https:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/patterns\/library\/knit-packer","description":"This pattern came about as a result of several conversations between good friends and fantastic allies. After a discussion on a facebook group, in which a member shared their work to help a good friend in a difficult situation, my good friend Janet and I started talking.  \r\n\r\nI came out in 2015,  and have been excited to share my discoveries and understandings of my gender as I've grown, and I've been very lucky to have friends who are not only keen to understand, but are happy to help the community whenever possible. The facebook post prompted a discussion about what packers are and how they help the trans community. Through this we discovered a need within the trans community, a need that knitting and crochet could alleviate. \r\nNow, several of us are working to get 65 packers and 20 pairs of breast forms in time for this holiday season. \r\n\r\nNow you're probably wondering what this pattern is. \r\n\r\nA Knit Packer is a gender affirming item that is worn to create the silhouette in your jeans. Typically these can be worn by trans and non-binary folks for a variety of reasons, one of which is to mitigate gender dysphoria. \r\n\r\nElastomer or silicone packers are expensive, difficult to source, and behind barriers such as only available online. While yes this item appears to be rather mature, the product itself is not. It's designed with the idea in mind that someone out there could use a packer. \r\n\r\nThey take very little time to knit up, are versatile  in size and stuffyness depending on your choice as you knit them. Be aware that should you decide to create something bigger, the fabric of the knit piece should remain tight to prevent stuffing from pushing out through the stitches. \r\n\r\nAlso this packer lets you decide if that's something you're comfortable with wearing. Better to try something free before spending money.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Crochet Pattern is available [Here][1]\r\n\r\nThis pattern will always remain free.

Since we're trying to make 20 pairs of these - which means 40 individual knockers - in a short amount of time, I wanted something with far more instant gratification. I like half double crochet because it creates a dense enough fabric much faster than single crochet. \r\n\r\nI also found the patterns I had on hand confusing and difficult to follow. I'm not a very experienced crocheter, so I wanted something easy to follow AND faster to produce. What I particularly like about this pattern is that, once you know how to spot the increases and decreases in the fabric, you don't need to count any more.

By design, the clear plastic bag easily indicates indicates to caregivers the amount of urine in the bag.  But it also telegraphs the contents to anyone visiting the patient.  In the case of hospice. It's just one more indignity at the end of life.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer knitters for Hopewell House in Portland, Oregon were asked by the caregivers to create a cover for the catheter bags being used. The caregivers were thrilled with the design.\r\n\r\nThis cover will fit two types of bags that attach to a hospital bed. One measures approximately 9\u201d high, 11\u201d at the bottom and tapers to 10\u201d at the top. The other is flat and roughly 12\" round with a plastic box on the front.  The cover has two buttons at the top, allowing an opening of about 4\u201d for the the hanger and tube.  Caregivers can easily check or change the bag.\r\n\r\nUsing a worsted weight acrylic yarn that can be machine washed and dried, the cover is knit in the round with a top and bottom 1x1 ribbing.  Two buttons are placed at the top on either side of the plastic hanger and tube.

Place the Ear Saver on the back of the head and fasten each mask strap to one of the buttons and give your ears a break! (See photo for how it's worn)\r\n\r\nFor this pattern, yarn weight, gauge, and button size are not crucial. However, make sure you use acrylic or cotton yarn so that it can be machine washed and dried. \r\n\r\nAlso, it's pretty easy to knit two (or more) at a time. If you've never done it, this is a great pattern to practice with since they knit up so quickly.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say I invented the concept of Ear Savers, but I did not. I had seen a crochet pattern (see link below). Since I don't crochet, I looked all over for a knit pattern, but did not find one anywhere, so I made one up and published it here. I hope you find it helpful. Please do leave a comment and share any feedback. \r\n\r\n<br \/>\r\n**TIPS**\r\n*Thank you to PuffkloudCo for these two BRILLIANT tips:*\r\n\r\n1) If you only have half-inch buttons, place them side by side (like an 8) to make them sturdy enough.\r\n\r\n2) To make them adjustable (two sizes), simply add 4 buttons: Place the first set as the pattern calls for and an extra set further in. That way if the band is too long or stretched the wearer can use the inner buttons instead.\r\n\r\n<br\/>\r\n**HELPFUL VIDEOS:**\r\n\r\n**Knitting Help - How Should I Slip This Stitch?**\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9CTnjLFKFQA\r\n\r\n<br \/>\r\n**Knitting Help - Knit Front and Back, or kfb:**\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tmOymzswPZA\r\n\r\n<br \/>\r\n**Knitting Help - ssk, or slip-slip-knit**\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cg1ykku04is\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/>\r\n**UPDATE: April 16, 2020**\r\nModified row 4 for clarity (does not change the pattern).\r\nReplaced one K2tog in rows 5 and 6 with SSK, which is a left leaning decrease and makes the ear savers a little more balanced.\r\n\r\n<br\/>\r\n**UPDATE: April 12, 2020**\r\nUpdated the length of the ear savers, as some people are reporting that 4\" was a bit small.

The sock is designed with an eyelet round and a drawstring in order to keep the sock on. Once the drawstring is tied, the cuff is folded over to cover the bow. Another option to keep the sock on would be to use slipper bottom non-slip paint on the inside of the body of the sock. In this case, the sock could be made shorter, leaving off the fold over cuff. If you really love knitting ribbing, the sock is stretchy enough to go over a cast, so you could also just keep right on knitting to the desired length & the sock could be pulled over the cast past the heel (think tube sock).\r\n\r\nThis pattern is pithy & written for an experienced toe up sock knitter (just one pair of socks counts!).

We\u2019re wearing masks far more often and for longer periods than usual and that might create stress over the ears and chafing. To prevent that, we can attach the ear elastics to the buttons at each end of the knitted piece and it will stretch to fit different adult heads with no problem, as ribbing is quite stretchy.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve tried quite a few different Ear Savers patterns and they were all knit from one small end to the other, so it involved a lot of turning the work around and I thought it maybe could be done a bit quickly because there are a lot of people who could use them! \r\n\r\n**They\u2019re super beginner friendly too!** They\u2019re like tiny scarves you can make over and over and that will be put to good use right after! Plus, I added pictures for some techniques at the end and links to tutorials if you need it.\r\n\r\nMATERIALS\r\n\r\n- You\u2019ll need **light worsted\/worsted\/aran\/bulky weight or even two strands held together of fingering, sport or dk ACRYLIC or COTTON yarn** (work with what you have in your stash! Your fabric might look a bit different, but they\u2019ll all work just fine). *I\u2019ve been told that some hospitals and care centres don\u2019t accept acrylic yarn, so make sure to check the requirements of the place or person you\u2019re making it for! \r\n\r\n- Tapestry needle.\r\n\r\n- \u00be to 1 inch buttons (2), OR anything that would work like soda can tabs or bottle caps...\r\n\r\n- Big sewing needle that fits through your button holes and fingering yarn scraps to sew (ideally).\r\n\r\n**GAUGE\r\nNot very important.** Just knit, and have fun! You can test combinations of colors or weights... \r\n\r\nSIZES\r\nOne size with instructions for modifications included throughout the pattern.\r\n\r\nNEEDLES\r\nSize US 7 (4,5mm) for smaller yarn;\r\nSize US 8 (5mm) for bigger yarn.\r\n*You might want to adjust if you\u2019re a very tight or very loose knitter. I have a pretty average tension. \r\n\r\nYARDAGE\r\nLess than 10 yards should be enough.\r\n\r\n**I really hope you have fun knitting those. They're like useful little swatches, and the result doesn't matter too much, as long as it's stretchy, so the world is your oyster!!** \r\n\r\n\r\nI know these are very rough times for everyone, so I just wanted to say...\r\nTo those on the frontlines, essential workers and people giving time and money to help, THANK YOU! \r\n\r\nTo those staying home and making all the efforts to protect others, THANK YOU!

When I need an emergency heat pack, I fill a tube sock with rice, and microwave it. It's a perfect, quick solution for some relief- aside from one thing. It's ugly! So I made a cute cover that can hide the simple, no sew upcycle of a tube sock into a comfy heat pack. \r\n\r\nThis pattern includes lots of instructions for whatever kind of cover and pack you want to make. The covers are available in two sizes:\r\n\r\nThe Large Cover holds two heat packs, and is about ten inches wide and ten inches long. \r\n\r\nThe Small Covers hold one heat pack each, and 245 yards is plenty enough yarn to make two. This size is about 5 inches wide and ten inches long. \r\n\r\nThere are three ways to make the heat packs, including the no sew option, a one-seam option, and a fully sewn fabric option. \r\n\r\nAdditional supplies for this projects include:\r\n\r\n- Size H Hook\r\n- Size G Hook\r\n- Two tube socks (or a fat quarter of fabric with matching thread)\r\n- 2-3 cups of dry rice per heat pack\r\n\r\nOptional supplies:\r\n\r\n- Two matching buttons\r\n- Thread\r\n\r\nI love these covers because they protect your skin from the full heat of the rice packs, and they keep the rice hot for more time. \r\n\r\nGauge is not important for this pattern. Heavier weight yarn can be used, although it will block even more of the heat from getting through the heat pack. I find DK weight yarn to be the best suited for this. \r\n\r\nSome photos are included in the pattern.\r\n\r\nLastly, the texture and design of the covers is meant to appeal specifically to hand dyed yarn. The covers only need about 100 grams of yarn (approx 245 yards), and the texture is meant to compliment the color changes that often come with hand dyed yarn.  Perfect for if you only have one skein of your favorite yarn!\r\n\r\nGive the finished product as a gift during the cold winter months, or give this pattern as a gift alongside some beautiful hand dyed dk yarn!\r\n\r\nStill not sure what to do with your most special hank of yarn?
